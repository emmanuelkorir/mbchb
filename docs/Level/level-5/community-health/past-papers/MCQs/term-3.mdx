</details>

### Question 62

Which of the following statements is **TRUE**

Select one:

A. Only the population at risk contributes to the denominator of the cumulative incidence

B. All other things being equal, when a new prevention measure for a disease is developed, the prevalence of the disease will increase over time

C. if the incidence rate of a very serious disease is 75/100,000 person-years and the prevalence of this
disease in the population is 25/100,000, then the average duration of this disease must be 3 years

D. When calculating the incidence rate of a disease, it is necessary to follow all subjects for the same length of time

E. All other things being equal, when a treatment is developed that prolongs the life of people suffering from a disease, prevalence will decrease over time

<details>
  Answer A. Cumulative incidence is given by number of people who
  develop disease in a specific period divided by number of people at
  risk of getting the disease at the start of the period. Option B is
  wrong with prevention measures, prevalence decreases. Option C is
  also wrong. If prevalence is low ie less than 10%, prevalence =
  incidence x duration, which gives time as 25/75. Option D is wrong
  because unlike cumulative incidence given, incidence rate does not
  require complete folow up. Option E is wrong, with prolonged life
  there is increased prevalence over time.
