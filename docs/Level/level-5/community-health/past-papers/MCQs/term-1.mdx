### **Question 48**

Which of the following statements is **TRUE**?

A. Only the population at risk contributes to the denominator of the cumulative
incidence

B. When calculating the incidence rate of a disease, it is necessary to follow all
subjects for the same length of time

C. All other things being equal, when a new prevention measure for a disease is
developed, the prevalence of the disease will increase over time

D. If the incidence rate of a very serious disease is 75/100,000 person-years
and the prevalence of this disease in the population is 25/100,000, then the
average duration of this disease must be 3 years

E. All other things being equal, when a treatment is developed that
prolongs the life of people suffering from a disease, the prevalence of
the disease will decrease over time

<details>
  <summary>Check</summary>
  Answer A. Cumulative incidence is given by number of people who develop
  disease in a specific period divided by number of people at risk of getting
  the disease at the start of the period. Option C is wrong with prevention
  measures, prevalence decreases. Option D is also wrong. If prevalence
  is low ie less than 10%, prevalence = incidence x duration, which gives
  time as 25/75. Option B is wrong because unlike cumulative incidence
  given, incidence rate does not require complete folow up. Option E is
  wrong, with prolonged life there is increased prevalence over time.
