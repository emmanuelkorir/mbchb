# Biostatistics Practice Questions

### Question 1

Fasting blood glucose levels (FBGL) are measured on a random sample of 81 clients attending a
wellness clinic with the following results:
xÌ…= 5.2 g/dl; S<sup>2</sup>= 27.5 g/dl2

(a) Calculate the standard error of the mean (2 marks)

(b) Construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean FBGL in the population from which
this sample was drawn. (3 marks)

Note: t<sub>.975</sub> (80) = 1.9901

### Question 2

Suppose it is known that 10 percent of a certain population is color blind. If a random sample
of 25 people is drawn from this population, find the probability that:

(a) Three or fewer will be color blind (3 marks)

(b) Four or more will be color blind (2 marks)

### Question 3

If the mean number of serious accidents per year in a large factory (where the number of
employees remains constant) is five, find the probability that in the current year there will be:

(a) No accidents

(b) One accident

(c) Two or more

### Question 4

The probability of experiencing moderate to severe side-effects with a new drug is 0.03. If
200 people take the new drug then:

(a) What is the probability that more than 8 people will experience moderate to severe side-
effects?

(b) What is the probability that the observed proportion of patients (in the 200)
experiencing moderate to severe side-effects is less than 0.01?

(c) If the number of patients experiencing moderate to severe side-effects is distributed as a
Poisson count with a mean of 3, what is the probability that 2 or more people will
experience moderate to severe side-effects?
