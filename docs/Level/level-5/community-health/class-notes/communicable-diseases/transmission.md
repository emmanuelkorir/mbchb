# Transmission of Communicable Diseases

Dr Dismas Ongore, MBChB, MPH, PhD(Liverpool)

## Definitions

direct transmission
 Agent goes directly from one reservoir to the new host eg STI, Respiratory disease.
For control of indirect transmission, anatomical & physiological considerations,
sociological, economic and cultural factors important. 2. What is indirect transmission
A. Indirect transfer the agent passes through another host, usually referred to as a
VEHICLE (A contaminated material). A method of control of such transmission is via
decontamination to kill or remove micro-organisms. Control of transmission by vehicles
includes:
 Sterilization: A process used to achieve sterility. Absolute term meaning
absence of all viable micro-organisms. Refers to the freeing of an article from
all living organisms: Include viruses, bacteria ad their spores, and fungi and
their spores. Several methods are used for sterilization
o Heat: The only method of sterilization that is both reliable and
widely applicable. Heating above 100 degrees C to ensure bacterial
spores are killed. There is some concern that even this temperature is
insufficient to destroy prions
o Ionizing radiation: Employed in the sterilization of single use
disposable items. Include needles and syringes, latex catheters and
surgical gloves. Also in the food industry to reduce spoilage and
remove pathogens.
o Filtration: Used to remove bacteria and all larger micro-organisms
from liquids that are liable to be spoiled by heat e.g. blood serum
and antibiotic solutions. Industrial scale filtration is widely used to
reduce bacterial load and removecystsofprotozoawhicharenotkilled
by chlorination in the production of drinking water.
 Disinfection: A process which reduces the number of contaminating microorganisms, particularly those liable to cause infection. To a level which is
deemed no longer harmful to health.Term used to denote the freeing of an
article from some or all of its burden of contaminating organisms
 Decontamination: A general term for the treatment used to make equipment
safe to handle. Includes microbiological, chemical, radioactive and other
contamination.
B. Indirect transfer via INTERMEDIATE HOST OR VECTOR. Agent passes through
another mechanism of transfer, usually referred to as an intermediate host or vector, before it
gets to the final host. Host in which the adult or sexually mature forms of parasite are found is
referred as the definitive host. Host in which the intermediate forms are found is referred as
the intermediate host.
VECTORS:
Transmission vectors: Many diseases conveyed by blood-sucking vectors. Referred to
as vector-borne disease. Vector acts as an agent of dissemination or inoculation or
both of a parasite.
Biological transmission by vectors: Transmission by a vector is said to be biological.
When an essential part of the life-cycle of the parasite takes place in the body of the
vector. An interval of time elapses before the vector can transmit the parasite to
another host. THIS PERIOD IS KNOWN AS THE EXTRINSIC INCUBATION
PERIOD AND IS TEMPERATURE DEPENDENT. A possible implications of
biological transmission for disease prevalence and control measures.
Vectors are agents of dissemination or inoculation of parasite.
Association between insects and humans – Recognized from antiquity, Religious
texts, Bible Exodus
Association between insects and ill health
 Fedtschenko in 1868: Dracunculus medinesis and Cyclops.
 Patrick Manson, phsician and parasitologist in 1877: Fiariasis, Wuchereria
bancrofti and Culex quinquefasciatus).
 Ronald Ross in 1897: Anopheles and malaria.
Effects of insects on human health:
 Transmit diseases
 Nuisance and annoyance
 Induce allergies
 True parasites: Live in the superficial layers of the skin
Methods of disease transmission:
 Biological or cyclical: Transformation/multiplication, Extrinsic incubation
period (7-21 days)
 Mechanical vectors: Accidental vectors, Carry agents on their bodies. No
obvious morphological changes or development
 Transovarial transmission: Pathogens actually penetrate the ovaries –
Immature stages from eggs infected, Infection persists to the adult stage.
Vector biology:
 General characteristics:
o Numerous segments
o Cuticle: Covers entire body, Protective exoskeleton (Chemically hardened)
o Three regions: Head, thorax and abdomen.
 Head:
o Pair of compound eyes
o A pair segmented antennae
o Pair of palps: Near the mouthparts. Chemoreceptors which detect smell and taste.
o The mouthparts: Consist of a number of components. Vary greatly according to the
feeding habits of the insects.
 Thorax:
o Walking legs
o Wings:
A pair of fore and hind wings
Halteres: A pair of knob-like structures. Sensory organs: flight orientation and
balance
 Abdomen: Usually sub-cylindrical. Up to eleven segments.
o Hairs and scales. Cover body. Impart color to head, thorax, abdomen, legs and wings
 Respiratory system: Direct gaseous diffusion of oxygen to tissues
o Spiracles: Small circular openings on cuticle. Allow air to enter the body.
 Special sensory organs:
o Compound and simple eyes (ocelli)
o Antennae, halteres and palps and also various receptors
o Respond to temperature, humidity, food stimuli and host odors.
o Blood-sucking insects, such as tse-tse flies and tabanids, Sight is important in
locating hosts
 Alimentary canal:
o Mouthparts: Structure, size and formation. Complex and varied
o Three regions: Fore, mid and hind gut.
o The fore gut: Mouth and leads to the buccal cavity: Pharynx, Oesophagus,
Proventriculus (gizzard). The muscular, Acts as valve, Prevents food being
regurgitated
o A pair of salivary glands: Ventrally in the thorax. The composition of the saliva
Varies according to the insects. Contains anticoagulins: prevent blood ducked from
host from clotting. Contains allergens: Localized swelling, itching and irritation: Host
reaction to saliva injected into the skin. Severity of irritation depends on: Species of
blood-sucking insect. Individual reaction of the host.
 Reproductive system
o Females reproductive organs: A pair of ovaries with several egg-tubes or ovarioles
within which eggs are developed.
o Paired oviducts
o Common oviduct or the uterus
o One or two pairs of accessory glands: Secrete a mucous cement-like substance,
Deposited on the eggs as laid
o Accessory glands produce water-proofing agent or an adhesive: Glues the eggs to
various substrates. Provide material for the formation of the egg-pod
o Spermatheca: Lined with cuticle. Consists of one to three receptacles. Filled with
spermatozoa from the male during copulation (fertilizes each egg as passed down the
oviduct). Insects need mate only once 3. Discuss Vector bionomics
o Quiescence: Temporarily cease to develop or become active. Environmentally
unfavorable periods.
• Hibernation
• Quiescence to resist cold conditions such as during winter
o Aestivation: Relatively inactive to resist drought or high temperatures
o Diapause: Development of the egg, larva, nymph or adult arrested. May last a few
weeks or several years. Initiated by many external factors including changes in day
length and temperatures. Must be subjected to appropriate stimuli to ‘break’ the
diapause. Eg. Eggs of many Aedes mosquitoes enter diapause. Allows various stages
of insects to survive under adverse conditions.
o Blood-feeding: Blood meal required for – Successful completion of the reproductive
cycle.
Anaautogenous development: Blood-meal is necessary to obtain nutrients for the
development of the eggs
Speed of digestion of the blood-meal depends: On temperature and Most tropical
species 2-3days. Searches for suitable larval habitat for oviposition. Takes another
blood-meal and after 2-3 days. Further batch of eggs is matured
GONOTROPHIC CYCLE: The process of blood-feeding and egg-maturation,
followed by oviposition. In most tropic species it’s 2-3 days and is repeated several
times in the life cycle
Oviposition: After mating and blood-feeding vectors. Preferred larval habitat sought.
Many different types preferred. Large and more or less permanent habitats
Small and often temporary breeding places. Habitats with or without acquatic
vegetation. Exposed sunlit waters. More shaded breeding places
ADULT BIOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR
 Crepuscular or nocturnal: Blood-feeding and oviposition occur in the evenings, at
night or early in the morning around sunrise.
 Anthrophilic: Species that usually bite human
 Zoophilic: Feed mainly on other animals
 Ornothophilic: Feed mainly on birds
Feeding behavior
 Endophagic: Enter houses to feed
 Exophagic: Bite their hosts outside
Resting behavior
 Endophilic: Rest inside houses after feeding (this is most vulnerable point of
the vector eg use of residual long acting insecticides)
 Exophilic: Rest outdoors after feeding
The biting behavior: Important in the epidemiology of disease transmission.
The resting behavior: Important consideration in planning control measures. 4. Discuss the various disease vectors
 Anopheles: About 460 species are recognized. Over 100 can transmit human malaria.
Only 30–40 commonly transmit parasites of the genus Plasmodium, which cause
malaria in humans in endemic areas.
Anopheles gambiae: One of the best known Anopheles. Predominant role in the
transmission of the most dangerous malaria parasite species Plasmodium falciparum.
Some species also can serve as the vectors of filariasis-causing species Wuchereria
bancrofti and Brugia malayi, and viruses such as one that causes O'nyong'nyong
fever.
 Aedes: Originally found in tropical and subtropical zones. Now found on all
continents excluding Antarctica. Some species have been spread by human activity.
Aedes albopictus, a most invasive species, was recently spread to the New World,
including the US, by the used-tire trade.
The generic name comes from the Ancient Greek ἀηδής, aēdēs, meaning "unpleasant"
or "odious". Some species of this genus transmit serious diseases, including dengue
fever and yellow fever.
Aedes species are typical small mosquitoes. They usually have black and white stripe
markings on their body and legs. They usually bite only during the day
Aedes aegypti and other mosquitoes have a complex life-cycle with dramatic changes
in shape, function, and habitat.
Capable of undergoing diapause. Female mosquitoes lay their eggs on the inner, wet
walls of containers with water. Larvae hatch when water inundates the eggs as a
result of rains or the addition of water by people. Their eggs can withstand
desiccation for several months. Even if all larvae, pupae, and adults were eliminated
at some point in time, repopulation will occur as soon as the eggs in the containers are
flooded with water. Unfortunately, there is no effective way to control the eggs
 Culex: Culex is a genus of mosquitoes, several species of which serve as vectors of
one or more important diseases of birds, humans and other animals. Diseases include
arbovirus infections, filariasis , West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis, St. Louis
encephalitis, and avian malaria. Occur worldwide except for the extreme northern
parts of the temperate zone. The adult mosquito can measure from 4–10 mm (0.16–
0.39). The developmental cycle takes two weeks and is by complete metamorphosis.
 Tsetse fly, also known as tik-tik flies: Large biting flies that inhabit much of midcontinental Africa between the Sahara and the Kalahari deserts. They live by feeding
on the blood of vertebrate animals. The primary African biological vectors of
trypanosomes, which cause human sleeping sickness and animal trypanosomiasis,
also known as nagana. Tsetse include all the species in the genus Glossina, which are
generally placed in their own family, Glossinidae. There are 23 species of tsetse flies.
Diseases transmitted by tsetse flies kill 250,000–300,000 people per year. Tsetse have
an unusual life cycle which may be due to the richness of their food source.
 Phlebotominae – sandfly: are a subfamily of the family Psychodidae. In several
countries their common name is sand fly. The Phlebotominae include many genera of
blood-feeding (hematophagous) flies, including the primary vectors of leishmaniasis.
In the Old World sand flies in the genus Phlebotomus spread leishmaniasis.
Phlebotomine females, and only females, suck blood from various mammals, reptiles
and birds. Some species are selective, whereas others bite any suitable host they find.
As far as is known all species need a blood meal for every following clutch of eggs.
Proteins and other nutrients in the blood they eat enable the female to produce the
proteins and fats necessary for them to produce eggs after using up their bodily food
stores. In feeding on blood the flies use their mouthparts to start the host bleeding.
They then suck up the exposed blood. Like practically all blood-feeding parasites,
they inject biochemicals that inhibit blood clotting, plus some that stimulate host mast
cells to produce histamine; this distend capillary vessels, thereby promoting blood
flow.
One blood meal can support the production of about 100 eggs. Females lay their eggs
in humid soil rich in organic matter. Sand flies are small; a body size of about 3mm in
length is typical for many species, which aids them in escaping notice. Their bite is
not always felt, but leaves a small round, reddish bump that starts itching hours or
days later. Use of insect repellent is recommended in areas where sand flies are
present.
 Similium: A black fly (sometimes called a buffalo gnat, turkey gnat, or white socks)
is any member of the family Simuliidae. Over 1,800 species of black flies are known
(of which 11 are extinct). Most species belong to the immense genus Simulium. Most
black flies gain nourishment by feeding on the blood of mammals, including humans,
although the males feed mainly on nectar. They are usually small, black or gray, with
short legs, and antennae. They are a common nuisance for humans. They spread
several diseases, including river blindness in Africa (Simulium damnosum and S.
neavei). Eggs are laid in running water, and the larvae attach themselves to rocks.
Breeding success is highly sensitive to water pollution. The larvae use tiny hooks at
the ends of their abdomens to hold on to the substrate, using silk holdfasts and threads
to move or hold their place. The larva scrapes the fan's catch into its mouth every few
seconds. Black flies depend on lotic habitats to bring food to them. They will pupate
under water and then emerge in a bubble of air as flying adults. They are often preyed
upon by trout during emergence. Adult males feed on nectar, while females also feed
on blood. Some species in Africa can range as far as 40 mi (64 km) from aquatic
breeding sites in search of their blood meals, while other species have more limited
ranges.
