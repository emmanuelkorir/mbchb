# Immunity

Dr Dismas Ongare, MBChB, MPH, PhD (Liverpool)

## Immune System

Immune system: A system of biological structures and processes within an organism. Protects against disease. Detects and identifies and kills a wide variety pathogenic agents. Distinguishes them from the organism's own healthy cells and tissues.

## Innate Immune System

Comprises the cells and mechanisms that defend the host from infection by other organisms, in a non-specific manner. The cells of the innate system recognize and respond to pathogens in a **generic/non-specific** way. Does not confer long-lasting or protective immunity to the host. Provide immediate defense against infection, and are found in all classes of plant and animal life.

## Adaptive Immune System

If pathogens successfully evade the innate response. Protection accorded by the adaptive immune system. Activated by the innate response. Immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen.

## Adaptive vs Innate Immune System

| Innate Immune System                         | Adaptive Immune System                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Response is non-specific/generic             | Pathogen & antigen specific response         |
| Exposure leads to immediate maximal response | Lag time between exposure & maximal response |
| Cell-mediated & humoral components           | Cell-mediated & humoral components           |
| No immunological memory                      | Exposure leads to immunological memory       |
| Found in nearly all forms of life            | Found only in **Jawed vertebrates**          |

## Immune Response

Two different types of adaptive immunological reaction may occur:

- Humoral immunity which consists of synthesis and release of free antibody into the blood and other body fluids. Acts by coating bacteria to enhance their phagocytosis. Acts by combination with and neutralization of bacterial toxins. The other arm consists of production of sensitized lymphocytes.

Effectors of cell mediated immunity (CMI): Confers protection against organisms such as the tubercle bacillus and viruses. Which are characterized by an ability to live and replicate within the cells of the host. Antibody activity is associated with gamma globulin fraction of serum. Referred to as immunoglobulins Divided into different classes on the basis of the structure of their 'backbone' rather than on their specificity for given antigens. In the human five major structural types or classes can be distinguished: Immunoglobulin G (abbreviated to IgG), IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE.

- The cell-mediated immune response: Immunity to those infectious organisms which have developed the capacity for living and multiplying within the cells of the host is. Masterminded by the T-lymphocytes independently of Blymphocytes. T-cells are antigen-sensitive in that they show specificity for antigen in their response to carriers. T-cells have surface receptors which recognize antigen The two arms of the cell-mediated immune response: Proliferation of the stimulated T-cells provides mechanism for amplification of the cell-mediated immune response Depends upon two major effector mechanisms Generation of cytotoxic cells Release of biologically active factors termed lymphokines which modulate behavior of other cells, particularly the mononuclear phagocytes in particular monocytes and macrophages
