# Malaria

Dr Dismas Ongore, MBChB, MPH, PhD(Liverpool)

## Epidemiology

Italian mal’aria or “bad air”, paludism, latin for ‘palus’ or marsh. “Swamp” Most important cause of fever-related morbidity and mortality most of sub-Saharan Africa. Geographical distribution: Deeply entrenched in: Tropical Africa, South east Asia, Parts of the Indian sub continent, Much of central and south America.

Eradicated from: The whole of Europe, Most of North America including the whole of the USA, Most of the Carribean, Large parts of northern and southern South America, Australia, Singapore, Japan, Korea and Taiwan. Impact: Significant impediment to human development in poor countries: 450 – 500,000 clinical episodes. Over 400,000 deaths annually mainly in children in Africa. 6% of their GDP as a result of the disease (most African country 6% of GDP is directed to healthcare)

## Agent, cycle and reservoir Agent

Protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium. Four species infect humans under natural conditions. **Plasmodium falciparum, P.ovale, P.vivax and P.malariae.** The life cycle alternating which has sexual and asexual cycles in mosquito and in human respectively.

- **Asexual cycle:**
  Initiated by **sporozoites** injected by an infected female Anopheles mosquito. Process of schizogony in two phases. Starts by a process of **tissue** or **exo-erythrocytic schizogony** which takes 5-15 days which occurs in hepatocytes. Concludes by formation of merozoites capable infecting erythrocytes starting erythrocytic schizogony.

:::warning REMEMBER
In P vivax and P ovale proportion of sprozoites develop into forms called hypnozoites capable of remaining - dormant for up to 10 months.Responsible for true relapses seen in P.vivax and P.ovale.
:::

**Erythrocytic shizogony** initiated by **merozoites** from exo-erythrocytic cycle. Grow into **trophozoites** which feed on hemoglobin. Divide by asexual schizogony to mature into schizonts. Eventually produce 6-32 merozoites per schizonts in 48 – 72 hours. A proportion of merozoites transform to gametocytes ready to initiate the sexual stages

2. **Sexual phase:**

Gametocytes transform into gametes which are taken up mosquitoes during a blood meal. Fertilization occurs in the mosquito stomach. Rounded zygote formed which transforms into **elongated ookinete** which pierces epithelium lining mosquito stomach. Ookinete transforms into a rounded **oocyst** in which asexually sporogony occurs in 8 – 16 days to produce **sporozoites (infective stage)**.

The whole process of sexual development is temperature dependent and does occur below 15.6 degrees. Constitutes **biological transmission**
Periodicity: erythrocytic cycle (up to RBC rupture). Tissue parasite (shcizogony)

**Reservoir:** Humans in particular children and especially infants who are the major gametocyte carriers. P.malariae is common to humans and the great apes

## Transmission

Natural transmission is by the bite of certain species of Anopheles mosquitoes. Blood transfusion with unscreened blood also possible. Syringe transmission by intravenous drug users also occurs. _Historical therapeutic transmission used to treat certain forms of schizophrenia._

1. **Anopheles mosquito and the vector**
   Mosquitoes of genus Anopheles have world wide distribution.The genus has 416 species of which 40 can transmit malaria. Only 15 are major vectors of malaria. Only 1 – 2 species responsible for maintaining transmission in any one areaIn sub-Saharan **Africa Anopheles gambiae** and the major vectors **Anopheles funestus**. These are the world’s most efficient vectors. The vector: **Anopheles gambiae complex** is the major vector. Widespread sub-Saharan Africa. World’s most efficient malaria vector. Larvae found in temporary habitats including pools, puddles, hoof prints and borrow pits, but also rice fields.

The Anopheles gambiae complex consists of at least seven morphologically indistinguishable species of mosquitoes in the genus Anopheles. The complex was recognized in the 1960s and includes the most important vectors of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly of the most dangerous malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. It is one of the most efficient malaria vectors known.

- Predominantly feeds on humans: **anthrophilic**
- Comes inside houses to feed: **endophagic**
- Rests predominantly indoors after feeding: **endophilic**

**An.funestus** is the other major vector in sub-Saharan Africa. It is widespread in Africa south of the Sahara. Breeds in more or less permamnent waters, with vegetation, such as swamps, marshes, edges of streams, rivers and ditches with overhanging shade

- Predominantly feeds on humans: **anthrophilic**
- Comes inside houses to feed: **endophagic**
- Rests predominantly indoors after feeding: **endophilic**

## Mosquito Life Cycle, Gonotrophic cycle

Adult mosquitoes emergence from the pupa and mate shortly after wards. One mated the female stores enough sperm in spermtheca. Females produces eggs in masses which are fertilized by the sperms from the spermatheca. In the tropical regions, blood digestion takes 3 days and during this time the eggs are mature- 24 hours half gravid, 72 hours full gravid. A gravid mosquito leaves the resting place to look for a suitable oviposition site. After laying the eggs the mosquito seeks another blood meal, after which it also rest
for 3-4 days to digest the blood meal, develop eggs and lay eggs

## Pathogenesis of Malaria

All the manifestations of malarial illness are caused by the infection and subsequent destruction of the red blood cells by the asexual forms of the malaria parasite. All types of malaria manifest with common symptoms such as fever. Severe malaria and death is more often seen in cases of P. falciparum infection. Invasion and subsequent destruction the red cells basis of pathogenesis. Cyclic rupture of RBC, release of lipid ‘toxins’ and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine production by host endothelial cells.

- **Fever** is common to all malaria parasites. Toxic products of the parasite and red cell destruction products are taken up by leukocytes and produce endogenous pyrogens from leukocytes. These act on the hypothalamus to release prostaglandins which act upon the posterior hypothalamus. The consequence is sympathetic vasoconstriction with decreased heat dissipation leading to the classical rigor.
- **Anaemia:** Hemolysis of parasitized red cells. Hemolysis of non-parasitized red cells. Dyserythropoiesis. Anemia is often out of proportion to the degree of hemolysis.
- **Cerebral malaria:** Common feature Plasmodium falciparum. Pathological changes seen in the brain due to blocking of the capillaries with
  parasitized red cells. Necrotic lesions form in the cerebral tissues which lead to stasis in the cerebral circulation. Stickiness of the erythrocytes. Adhesions to the capillary endothelium. Obstruction of the small vessels

## Immunity to malaria

**Antibody mediated immunity** is directed against **erythrocytic stage (blood borne forms)**. Circulating antibodies produced against the blood-borne forms cannot eliminate the exo-erythrocytic stage. Parasites escape from the cytocidal action of humoral antibody by continually
altering their antigenic construction presented to the immune system by a process of antigenic variation. After protective antibodies appear to a wave of antigens, new antigens are synthesized. Parasite escapes from waves of antibodies by changing to a further antigenic variant. The body attempts to produce antibodies to the new variant. Malaria continue to infect the host with diminishing intensity until antibodies formed to a critical proportion of antigenic variants circulating in the area. So that in hyper-endemic areas for malaria children subjected to repeated attacks for first few years of life. Until immunity against a significant proportion of the antigenic variants achieved.

**Acquired immunity:** The presence of genetically and antigenically distinct strains of the parasites in a given locality force the host to mount immune response against these different strains and antigenic variants. The acquisition of immunity against malaria is, therefore, very slow and not very effective and remains species specific and strain specific. In areas with stable endemic malaria and intense malaria transmission acquired immunity develops slowly. Children born to immune mothers are protected against disease during their first half year of life by maternal antibodies. The risk of clinical disease increases after 6 months of age and infants become susceptible to severe disease and death.

Due to repeated and frequent infections, the frequency of clinical disease begins to diminish and the risk of mortality sharply decreases. By about 5 years the risk of clinical disease and death decreases. By adulthood, most inhabitants generally possess semi-immunity and severe clinical disease is uncommon even in the presence of infection. Parasites are not completely eliminated. At about 2 to 5 years of age, due to repeated and frequent infections, the frequency of clinical disease begins to diminish and the risk of mortality sharply decreases, and by adulthood, most inhabitants generally possess sterilizing immunity.

## Clinical features of malaria

1. **Uncomplicated malaria**
   Intermittent repeated courses of fever. Periods of freedom from any symptoms. Incubation period varies. Preceded by some premonitory symptoms. Consists of three stages:
   - The cold stage starts: Shivering and rigor. Lasts from one-quarter to one hour
   - The hot stage follows: Intense heat with. Temperature rises up to 40-41 degrees C. Lasts 2-6 hours.
   - The sweating stage follows: Profuse sweating. Lasts 2-4 hours.

The whole febrile paroxysms: Lasts 8-12 hours. Febrile response: Rapture of the red cell by mature schizonts. Discharge of merozoites into the blood. Varies with the different species of parasite.

- Anaemia common feature of P falciparum.
- Cerebral malaria common feature P falciparum.

2. **Severe Clinical Malaria**

- Cerebral malaria – case fatality if untreated ~ 50%
- Severe anemia – may require transfusion
- Hemoglobinuria (black water fever)
- Pulmonary edema
- Thrombocytopenia
- Renal failure
- Metabolic acidosis
- Hypoglycemia

## Management

**Diagnosis:**

- High index of suspicion, Finding malaria parasites
- Peripheral blood smear (Both thick and thin films prepared) Fields, Leishman’s stain or Giemsa stain.
- Serological methods
- Rapid diagnostic tests: Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) detect species-specific circulating parasite antigens targeting either the histidine-rich protein-2 of P. falciparum or a parasite-specific lactate dehydrogenase. May enhance diagnostic speed. Occasionally negative in patients with high parasitemia, and their sensitivity below 100 parasites/μl is low.

**Management**

1. **Treatment**

- Schizonticidal drugs: Asexual phase.
- Tissue schizonticidal drugs: Exo-erythrocytic or liver forms.
- \*\*Radical cure - P.vivax and P.ovale: Tissue schizonticide. For liver forms. To prevent relapses.

2. **Chemoprophylaxis**: Causal or suppressive

- **No true causal prophylactic**: No drugs effective against sporozoites
- **Primaquine** effective exoerythrocytic forms
- **Proguanil** and **pyrimethamine:** Active on P.falciparum liver forms
- Blood schizonticides: Suppress the erythrocytic stages, Abort attack of malaria
- P.vivax and P.ovale: Suppressive drugs combined with radical cure, To prevent relapses.

## Malariometric survey/ malaria survey

Natural transmission depends on the presence and relationship between the host agent and environment.These interact to provide varieties in the intensity of malaria in an area. Prevention and control preceded by evaluation of amount and conditions of transmission. Involves collection of data on human host, insect vector and the environment.

**Malaria survey:**
Human host: Large number of people, especially infants and children examined by several methods. Classically estimation of the spleen rate done in a proportion of children aged 2-10 years. Children examined for palpable enlarged spleens standing or lying down.

**Basis of malaria endemicity:**

- Hypoendemic malaria with spleen rate of 0-10%
- Mesoendemic malaria with spleen rate of 11-50%
- Hyperendemic malaria with spleen rates consistently over 50%. The spleen rate in adults is also high
- Holoendemic malaria with spleen rate consistently over 75%. The spleen rate in adults is low; the strongest adult tolerance is found.

**Alternate classification**

Parasite rates: Children 2 – 9 years examined for malaria parasites which forms basis for classification.

- Hypoendemic: Parasite rate in children aged 2-9 years is less than 10%
- Mesoendemic: Parasite rate in children aged 2-9 years is 11-50%
- Hyperendemic: Parasite rate in children aged 2-9 years is 50-75%
- Holoendemic: Parasite rate in children aged 2-9 years is constantly more than 75%

## Malaria control

Control achieved by action against:

- Adult mosquitoes using several measures
- Larvae by several antilarval measures
- Environmental control

1. **Control directed against adults:**

- Personal protection using mosquito nets
- Mosquito proof screening of houses and dwellings
- Suitable insect repellents in the form of oils, creams or aerosols. Provide temporary protection. Preparations contain: Diethyltoluamide (DET), Dimethyl phthalate (DMP). Applied to exposed areas of skin. Avoid the eyes.
- Residual house-spraying: Control focused on the adults. Application of residual insecticides. Interior surface of walls, ceilings and roof of houses. Effectiveness of residual spraying depends on the indoor resting habits of the mosquitoes.

2. **Control directed against larvae:**

- Physical, mechanical or environmental control
- Filling in, source reduction and drainage; water filled tree holes, ponds and small marshes
- Removal of container habitats including abandoned cans, metal drums, canoes, pots, tires etc can be removed and the breeding sources greatly reduced or eliminated.
- Draining swamps and marshes and filling in habitats; impracticable agitates vectors in temporary small pools and puddles
- Habitat changes including altering aquatic habitats like cutting down overhanging vegetation to increase sunlight or planting vegetation near water for sun-loving species.
- Impoundments including excavating marshy areas and forming well-defined vertical banks which completely alters the habitat making it unsuitable for mosquitos.

3. **Chemical control:**
   - Paris green (a copper aceto-arsenite): Earlier chemicals used to prevent mosquito breeding. Applied to the water surface as fine dusts.Stomach poison.
   - Larvicidal oils used consistently. Reduced malaria transmission in localized areas.
   - Diesel oils and fuel oils or kerosene used. Sprayed on the water larvae. Physical blocking their tracheae and suffocating them
   - Habitats to be treated every 7-10 days
   - Larvae hatching are killed before they pupate.
4. **Biological control:**
   Do not cause any chemical pollution. Advocated as a better approach than insecticidal methods. **Predatory fish** have reduced larval populations. Debatable whether broken transmission cycle. Predators not specific. May eat harmless and beneficial insects.

5. **Environmental control**
   Decreasing human-mosquito contact.

## Malaria vaccines

Major challenge is determining dormant form to target. Parasites escape from the cytocidal action of humoral antibody by _continually altering their antigenic construction_ presented to the immune system by _a process of antigenic variation_. After protective antibodies appear to a wave of antigens, new antigens are synthesized.

Malaria Vaccines background: One of the greatest challenges of medicine has been the development of an effective and safe vaccine against malaria. Despite the persistent efforts for more than a century the malaria vaccine has remained elusive. Confident promise of researchers in the mid-1980s that an effective vaccine against P. falciparum would be available within a decade remained elusive.

### Vaccine Types

- The pre-erythrocytic vaccines
- Anti-disease vaccination
- The erythrocytic stage vaccines
- Asexual Blood-Stage Vaccines
- Transmission-Blocking Vaccines.

#### Transmission-Blocking Vaccine

Current approved malaria vaccine. The only approved vaccine as of 2015 is **RTS,S.** It requires **four injections**, with a **26–50% efficacy**. Currently the first malaria vaccine provided to young children in selected areas of three sub-Saharan African countries - Ghana,
Kenya, and Malawi through a Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP).

:::warning NOTE
Not recommend in babies between 6 and 12 weeks of age due to low efficacy.
:::

The **RTS,S malaria vaccine**: RTS,S is a scientific name given to this malaria vaccine candidate and represents its composition.

- The **‘R’** stands for the **central repeat region of Plasmodium (P.) falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP)**
- The **‘T’** for the **T-cell epitopes of the CSP**
- The **‘S’** for **hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)**
  These are combined in a **single fusion protein (‘RTS’)** and co-expressed in yeast cells with free HBsAg. The **‘RTS’ fusion protein** and **free ‘S’ protein** spontaneously assemble in **‘RTS,S’ particles**. RTS,S also contains the **AS01 adjuvant system**, and in scientific papers is usually referred to as **‘RTS,S/AS01’**.

**RTS,S vaccine** is the most recently developed recombinant vaccine. It consists of the **P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP)** from the pre-erythrocytic stage. The CSP antigen causes the production antibodies capable of preventing the invasion of hepatocytes. Additionally elicits a cellular response enabling the destruction of infected hepatocytes.

**RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S; trade name MosquirixTM)** is an injectable vaccine that provides partial protection against malaria in young children. Specifically, RTS,S is designed to prevent the malaria parasite from infecting, maturing, and multiplying in the liver after which the parasite would normally re-enter the bloodstream and infect red blood cells, leading to disease symptoms. RTS,S is the first and, to date, the only vaccine to show a protective effect against malaria among young children in Phase 3 clinical trials. Currently being piloted in Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi.
