# Communicable Diseases Prevention & Control

Dr Dismas Ongare, MBChB, MPH, PhD (Liverpool)

## Define infectious diseases, contagious disease and tropical diseases

Infectious disease: Historical term that preceded the biomedical sciences. Conventionally indirectly transmitted and cause is unknown

Contagious: transmitted mainly by contact, includes dreaded skin diseases eg leprosy

Tropical disease: diseases most common in the tropics due to conducive environment for transmission (includes social, economic, cultural and physical environment), poverty is a key

## Similarities between infectious, contagious and tropical diseases

- Due to specific agent
- Agent in reservoir
- Exit of agent from reservoir
- Transmission of that agent
- Entry of agent into host
- Host agent interaction

## Define communicable diseases

Can be said to one due to SPECIFIC AGENT OR ITS PRODUCTS that arises through the TRANSMISSION of agent or it�s product FROM RESERVOIR TO A SUSCEPTIBLE HOST. The transmission is either DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY through the agency of an intermediate host, vector or inanimate environment.

AGENT: Cause of the disease. Chiefly a micro-organism and helminthes. Capable of producing the disease

RESERVOIR: Human, animal or arthropod, Soil or inanimate matter. Normal habitat of agent. Optimal conditions necessary for: Multiplication, Survival, Reproduction of agent

ESCAPE: The respiratory route: Natural function of breathing, or coughing. Gastro-intestinal route: Fecal matter. Genital route: Transmitted sexually. Urinary route: Agents appear in the urine. Abnormal route: No physiological function.

TRANSMISSION: Agent: Escapes in natural secretions, discharges or evacuations. Escapes in medium of biting insect. Most vulnerable during transmission as not in reservoir and not in host. Length of route between hosts crucial. Time and space important. Agents have developed survival mechanisms: Bacteria form spores, Protozoa form cysts.

Direct transmission: Reservoir to the new host: STI and Respiratory diseases. Physical environmental conditions important. Socioeconomic factors important. Proximity of people

Indirect transmission:

1. passive: Vehicle: Contaminated material or objects: Handkerchiefs, toys, soiled clothes, bedding, Water, food or milk, Biological products such as blood. Intermediate means of transport. Agent may or may not multiply
2. Active: Another host utilized by agent.

- Definitive host: Adult or sexually mature forms
- Intermediate host: Intermediate forms

ENTRY OF AGENT: Routes of entry: Virtually the same as those of escape of the agent. Portal of entry and development of the disease synonymous: Pulmonary tuberculosis, Gastrointestinal tuberculosis.

DEVELOPMENT OF DISEASE Host susceptibility: Host resistance or immunity. Agent factors: Infectivity, virulence, pathogenicity and antigenicity. Pathogenic infection. Incubation period

In summary, the concept of transmission of communicable diseases. Agent inside the reservoir. Escape of the agent from the reservoir. Transmission of the agent. Entry of the agent into a new host. Development of the agent inside the host.

## Levels of prevention of communicable diseases

1. At the level of the reservoir
2. Exit from the reservoir
3. In the mechanism of transmission
   4 At the level of entry into the host
4. Inside the host

### Measures that can be taken for the different levels of prevention

Reservoir: depends on the disease and reservoir eg destruction of reservoir (rodents for plague) and treat the reservoir with drugs eg TB.

Escape: extremely difficult and few measures are feasible because involves physiological processes done by reservoir eg urination. Measures can be taken in abnormal route

Mechanisms of transmission: Many public health measures taken in combination or separately depending on mode of transmission. Interference with the life-cycle of vectors and intermediate host. Decontamination of the vehicle of spread: Treatment of water with chlorine, Sterilization of fomites

Entry into the host: Interrupt entry of the organisms. Barrier methods: ITNs, House screening, Wearing of shoes

Susceptible host: General health of the body (its prognostic), specific immunity for specific diseases/immunoprophylaxis (specific Ag administered, produce Ig against the diseases), Specify drugs capable of prevention of development of diseases (taken before a specified agent gets inside the body, use of chemoprophylactic agents)

## Development of microbiology

Microbiology: Living organisms of microscopic size. Antony van Leeuwenhoek 1675: �Animalcules� � living creatures. No concept of disease causation. Robert Koch � 1876: Germ theory of disease, Specific microorganism: Capable of causing human disease.

### Koch�s postulate

The microorganisms should be present invariably in the diseased individual. The etiologic agent should be isolated from the diseased individual. Inoculation of the agent into healthy experimental animal should produce disease similar to that observed initially. The presumed pathogen should be isolated from the animal with experimentally induced disease.

## Pathological agents

Variation in size and biologic complexity. Capable of growth outside of living host cells: Cultured on artificial medium. Incapable of growth outside of living host cells: Obligate intracellular parasites. Major groups of pathogens: Viruses: The smallest intact organisms, Demonstrated pathogenic potential. Cannot be seen with a light microscope. Obligate intracellular parasites. Depend entirely upon the host cell�s synthetic machinery for reproduction.

Bacteria, Chlamydiae and Rickettsiae: Larger and more complex than viruses. Visible under the light microscope. Many capable of independent growth. Prokaryotes: Lack a true cell nucleus. No clearly define nuclear membrane present: Genetic material lies within the cytoplasm. Fungi: Larger than bacteria, More advanced cell structure, Are eukaryotic: Genetic material is separated from the cell cytoplasm by a nuclear membrane. Some reproduce by budding (yeasts). Other forms grow in colonies of attached organisms (molds). Parasites: Term used to refer to a variety of protozoan and multicellular eukaryotic organisms. Many undergo complex life cycles. May involve several host species. Major health problems in Economically underdeveloped countries ? Unusual group of pathogens: prions: Proteinaceous infectious particles. Postulated to be composed of proteins without nucleic acid. Induce abnormal conformational changes in related host protein rather than replication. Causative agents of fatal neurodegenerative disorders in animals and humans

## Pathogenesis-How do microbes cause disease

- Mechanical effect eg the occlusion of capillaries by malaria parasites is possible
- Biochemical effects are however foremost. Complex chemical substances are often elaborated and released including toxin. Biochemical substances: Biochemical substances implicated in pathogenicity have major effects include the following: Interference with mechanical blocks to the spread infection set in the body - bacterial kinases. Solving or stopping ingestion of microbes by phagocytic white blood cells � leucocidins. Destruction of body tissues - haemolysins, necrotizing exotoxins. Causing generalized unfavorable collectively termed toxicity.

## Escape of agent from reservoir

A major point in a communicable disease process: Escape of agent from reservoir ? By and large utilizes normal physiological processes of the reservoir ? Normal physiological routes for escape

- The respiratory route: Natural function of breathing, or coughing The cough mechanism: Diaphragm and external intercostal muscles contract, creating a negative pressure around the lung. Air rushes into the lungs in order to equalize the pressure.The glottis closes and the vocal cords contract to shut the larynx. The abdominal muscles contract to accentuate the action of the relaxing diaphragm; simultaneously, the other expiratory muscles contract. These actions increase the pressure of air within the lungs. The vocal cords relax and the glottis opens, releasing air at over 100 mph. The bronchi and non-cartilaginous portions of the trachea collapse to form slits through which the air is forced, which clears out any irritants attached to the respiratory lining.

A sneeze, or sternutation: A semi-autonomous, convulsive expulsion of air from the lungs through the nose and mouth, usually caused by foreign particles irritating the nasal mucosa. A sneeze expels air forcibly from the mouth and nose in an explosive, spasmodic involuntary action resulting chiefly from irritation of the nasal mucous membrane. Sneezing is possibly linked to sudden exposure to bright light, sudden change (fall) in temperature, breeze of cold air, a particularly full stomach, or viral infection, and can lead to the spread of disease. The function of sneezing: To expel mucus containing foreign particles or irritants and cleanse the nasal cavity. During a sneeze, the soft palate and palatine uvula depress while the back of the tongue elevates to partially close the passage to the mouth so that air ejected from the lungs may be expelled through the nose.Because the closing of the mouth is partial, a considerable amount of this air is usually also expelled from the mouth.The force and extent of the expulsion of the air through the nose varies.

- Gastro-intestinal route: Fecal mater GIT: Responsible for the breakdown and absorption of various foods and liquids needed to sustain life. Many different organs have essential roles in the digestion of food, From the mechanical disrupting by the teeth to the creation of bile by the liver. The GI tract starts with the mouth and proceeds to the esophagus, stomach, small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum), and then to the large intestine (colon), rectum, and terminates at the anus. Also includes the pancreas and liver, and accessory organs of the gastrointestinal system that contribute materials to the small intestine Defecation: The human anus is situated between the buttocks, posterior to the perineum. It has two anal sphincters, one internal, the other external. These hold the anus closed until defecation occurs. One sphincter consists of smooth muscle and its action is involuntary; the other consists of striated muscle and its action is voluntary.

Role of the human anus: When the rectum is full, the increase in intra-rectal pressure forces the walls of the anal canal apart allowing the fecal matter to enter the canal. The rectum shortens as material is forced into the anal canal and peristaltic waves propel the feces out of the rectum. The internal and external sphincters of the anus allow the feces to be passed by muscles pulling the anus up over the exiting feces. This is the final act of digestion, by which organisms eliminate solid, semisolid, or liquid waste material from the digestive tract via the anus. Humans expel feces with a frequency varying from a few times daily to a few times weekly. Waves of muscular contraction (known as peristalsis) in the walls of the colon move fecal matter through the digestive tract towards the rectum. Undigested food may also be expelled this way, in a process called egestion.

- Urinary route: Agents appear in the urine The Urinary System is a group of organs in the body concerned with filtering out excess fluid and other substances from the bloodstream. The substances are filtered out from the body in the form of urine. Urine is a liquid produced by the kidneys, collected in the bladder and excreted through the urethra. Urine is used to extract excess minerals or vitamins as well as blood corpuscles from the body. The Urinary organs include the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The Urinary system works with the other systems of the body to help maintain homeostasis. The kidneys are the main organs of homeostasis because they maintain the acid base balance and the water salt balance of the blood. Urination is the release of urine from the urinary bladder through the urethra to the outside of the body. It is the urinary system's form of excretion. It is also known medically as micturition, voiding, uresis, or, rarely, emiction, and known colloquially by various names including peeing, weeing, and pissing. In healthy humans the process of urination is under voluntary control. In infants, some elderly individuals, and those with neurological injury, urination may occur as a reflex. It is normal for adult humans to urinate up to seven times during the day.

Physiology of micturition: Micturition is fundamentally a spinobulbospinal reflex facilitated and inhibited by higher brain centers such as the pontine micturition center and, like defecation, subject to voluntary facilitation and inhibition. In healthy individuals, the lower urinary tract has two discrete phases of activity: the storage (or guarding) phase, when urine is stored in the bladder; and the voiding phase, when urine is released through the urethra. The state of the reflex system is dependent on both a conscious signal from the brain and the firing rate of sensory fibers from the bladder and urethra. At low bladder volumes, afferent firing is low, resulting in excitation of the outlet (the sphincter and urethra), and relaxation of the bladder. At high bladder volumes, afferent firing increases, causing a conscious sensation of urinary urge. When the individual is ready to urinate, he or she consciously initiates voiding, causing the bladder to contract and the outlet to relax. Voiding continues until the bladder empties completely, at which point the bladder relaxes and the outlet contracts to reinitiate storage.

- Genital route: Transmitted sexually In simple terms, reproduction is the process by which organisms create descendants. This miracle is a characteristic that all living things have in common and sets them apart from nonliving things. In human reproduction, two kinds of sex cells or gametes are involved. Sperm, the male gamete, and the female gamete must meet in the female reproductive system to create a new individual. Sperm production: Spermatozoa are produced in the seminiferous tubules of the testes in a process called spermatogenesis. Round cells called spermatogonia divide and differentiate eventually to become spermatozoa. The entire process of sperm formation and maturation takes about 9-10 weeks.

Differences between male and female reproductive systems: The differences between the female and male reproductive systems are based on the functions of each individual's role in the reproduction cycle. A male who is healthy, and sexually mature, continuously produces sperm. The development of women's "eggs" are arrested during fetal development. At about 5 months gestation, the ovaries contain approximately six to seven million oogonia, which initiate meiosis. The oogonia produce primary oocytes that are arrested in prophase I of meiosis from the time of birth until puberty. The ovaries of a newborn baby girl contain about one million oocytes which declines to 400,000 to 500,000 by the time puberty is reached.This means she is born with a predetermined number of oocytes and cannot produce new ones. On average, 500-1000 oocytes are ovulated during a woman's reproductive lifetime. After puberty, during each menstrual cycle, one or several oocytes resume meiosis and undergo their first meiotic division during ovulation.

Escape of agent: Ejaculation: This is the discharge of semen from the male reproductive tract, usually accompanied by orgasm. It is the final stage and natural objective of male sexual stimulation, and an essential component of natural conception. In rare cases, ejaculation occurs because of prostatic disease. Ejaculation may also occur spontaneously during sleep (a nocturnal emission or "wet dream"). A usual precursor to ejaculation is the sexual arousal of the male, leading to the erection of the penis, though not every arousal nor erection leads to ejaculation. Penile sexual stimulation during masturbation or vaginal, anal, oral, or non-penetrative sexual activity may provide the necessary stimulus for a man to achieve orgasm and ejaculation. With regard to intravaginal ejaculation latency time, men typically reach orgasm 5�7 minutes after the start of penile-vaginal intercourse but 10 minutes is also a common intravaginal ejaculation latency time Female ejaculation: This is characterized as an expulsion of fluid from or near the vagina during or before an orgasm. Most of the research into the nature of the fluid focuses on determining whether it is or contains urine. Some believe the fluid is secreted by the paraurethral ducts through and around the human female urethra. But the exact source and nature of the fluid continue to be a topic of debate among medical professionals

- Abnormal route of escape: No physiological function being carried out by reservoir. Includes insect bites
