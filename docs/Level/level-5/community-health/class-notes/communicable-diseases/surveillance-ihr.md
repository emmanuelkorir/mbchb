# Disease Surveillance & International Health Regulations (IHR)

Dr Dismas Ongore, MBChB, MPH, PhD(Liverpool)

## Background

Communicable diseases most common cause of death, disability and illness. Present a large threat to the well-being of African communities. Yet have well-known interventions that are available for controlling and prevention. Inadequate information for action and planning. A watchful, vigilant approach to information gathering. Essential for defining problems and taking action. Uses epidemiological methods in the service of surveillance.

Surveillance is the ongoing systematic collection, collation, and analysis of data; and interpretation and dissemination of information for appropriate action.

## Types of Surveillance

1. Passive surveillance involves the collection of data as part of routine provision of health services
2. Active surveillance involves intentional efforts for case search, recording and reporting
3. Vertical surveillance
4. Integrated surveillance

## Intergrated Surveillance System

All surveillance activities are coordinated and streamlined. Resources are combined to collect information from a single focal point at each level. Several activities are combined into one integrated activity. Several activities take advantage of similar surveillance functions, skills, and resources and target populations.

### Objectives of integrated disease surveillance

- To provide a rational basis for decision-making and implementing public health interventions that are efficacious in responding to priority communicable diseases
- To improve the ability to detect and respond to diseases and conditions that cause high levels of death, illness and disability in the catchment area
- Improve health and well-being for the communities
- Strengthen the capacity of countries to conduct effective surveillance activities
- Integrate multiple surveillance systems so that forms, personnel and resources can be used more efficiently and effectively
- Improve the use of information for decision making
- Improve the flow of surveillance information between and within levels of the health system
- Improve laboratory capacity in identification of pathogens and monitoring of drug sensitivity
- Increase the involvement of clinicians in the surveillance system
- Emphasize community participation in detection and response to public health problems
- Strengthen the involvement of laboratory personnel in epidemiological surveillance

## Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy

Several activities from the different vertical programmes are coordinated and streamlined in order to make best use of scarce resources. Activities are combined taking advantage of similar surveillance functions, skills, resources and target population. Recommends coordination and integration of surveillance activities as relates to diseases of national and public health importance. Strengthening the disease surveillance system using the integrated disease approach involves the major surveillance functions.

## Steps in Integrated Surveillance

- Detect
- Report priority diseases
- Analyze and interpret data on priority diseases
- Investigate
- Respond to suspected outbreaks
- Prepare for disease epidemics
- Provide feedback
- Supervise

### 1. Detect priority diseases

Priority diseases and conditions: Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP: polio), Cholera, Dracunculiasis (Guinea worm), Measles (elimination), Neonatal tetanus, Plague, Viral hemorrhagic fever (e.g. Ebola, Rift Valley fever), Typhoid fever, Diarrhea in children<5 years of age, Bloody Diarrhea in all ages, TB, Leprosy, Malaria, New AIDS cases, Pneumonia in children <5 years of age, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs).

Sources of information for health systems: Passive surveillance - health registers. Active searches to find additional cases for a particular disease

### Case definitions

Standard set of criteria used to decide if a person has a particular disease. The case can be considered for reporting and investigation. Make use of both clinical and surveillance criteria.

Clinical case definition: Used by clinicians (doctors, nurses or clinical officers) who see patient with signs and symptoms. Provides the criteria for identifying appropriate and potentially life-saving treatment to offer the patient. Should be supported by diagnostic laboratory test to confirm and support of the diagnosis.

Surveillance case definition: Used to obtain an accurate detection of all cases of a disease or condition in a given population. Should exclude detection of other similar conditions

### 2. Report Priority Diseases

All health facilities, regardless of the controlling agency should report to the next level. Where summaries are made and sent to the next level. Use of health facility registers: All health facilities should use standardized procedures. For recording patient information including diagnosis. Cases of the priority diseases/conditions should be captured in the out-patient/in-patient registers.

#### Kinds of Reporting

- **Immediate Reporting:** Report information about an individual case when an epidemic prone disease is suspected and requires immediate notification. Report case-based information for diseases targeted for elimination or eradication or when an action threshold is crossed. Diseases in which a single suspected case is a suspected outbreak: Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), Cholera, Dracunculiasis (Guinea worm), Measles (elimination), Neonatal tetanus, Plague, Viral hemorrhagic fever (e.g. Ebola, Rift Valley fever) and Yellow fever.

- **Routine Summary Reporting:** Routinely report the total number of cases and deaths seen on monthly basis. These data will be analyzed at various levels and the results used to monitor progress towards disease reduction targets. Measure achievements of disease prevention activities at all levels and identify hidden outbreaks or problems so that early action can be taken. Diseases, reported monthly as summaries of cases and deaths: Diarrhea in children<5 years of age, Bloody Diarrhea in all ages, TB, Leprosy, Malaria, New AIDS cases, Pneumonia in children<5 years of age, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs).

### 3. Analyze & Interpret Data on Priority Diseases

Analysis of data by time, place and person: How many cases occurred. Where the cases occurred. When the cases occurred. The population most affected. Risk factors that contributed to transmission of the disease.

Draw conclusions from the analysis: The total number of cases and deaths under surveillance is up-to-date. The case fatality rates are calculated and up-to-date. The geographical distribution of the cases and deaths are described and include case fatality rates as appropriate. Compare the current situation with previous months, seasons and years. Determine if thresholds for action have been reached. Thresholds are markers that indicate when something should happen or change.

### 4. Investigate

An investigation: A method for identifying and evaluating people who have been exposed to an infectious disease or affected by unusual health event. Provides relevant information for use in taking immediate action and improving longer term disease prevention activities.

The purpose of an investigation: Verify the outbreak or the public health problem. Promptly verify reported outbreaks from health facilities or community rumors. This is important for making sure that timely decisions are made. Prevents expending resources on investigating events that are not true outbreaks of priority diseases. Collect information and laboratory specimens for confirming the diagnosis. Identify the source of infection or cause of the outbreak.

Decide to investigate: For some communicable diseases, a single suspected case is the trigger for taking action eg cholera and viral hemorrhagic fever. These are dangerous diseases with the potential for explosive outbreaks or with high case fatality rates if cases are not treated promptly.

When to conduct an investigation: Report of a suspected outbreak of a disease or a public health problem. An unusual increase is seen in the number of deaths during routine analysis of data. Alert or action threshold (for some only one case needed eg AFP) have been reached for specific priority diseases. Communities report rumors of deaths or about a large number of cases that are not being seen in the health facility.

### 5. Respond to Outbreak of a Priority Disease

Response should be immediate. Preparations should be made in advance of the outbreak. Measures should be taken in a timely way. Measures should be planned by an epidemic response team.

Criteria for selecting response: When outbreak is confirmed. Need for public health action is identified. Investigation results and data analysis conclusions reviewed.

Basis of selection of response activities: Proven measures to prevent unnecessary deaths or disabilities due to the specific cause of the problem. A mix of activities for immediately controlling the problem in the short-term and reducing the risk of ongoing transmission in the long-term through prevention activities. Participation from the community, health care facilities and the district personnel.

Response activities includes: Inform and educate the community. Improve access to clean water. Improve safe disposal of human waste. Improve food handling practices. Reduce exposure to mosquitoes. Control vectors. Disseminate the technical recommendations appropriate for the outbreak.

### 6. Supervise & Provide Feedback

Reporting: Often, health facilities reliably report surveillance data to the next level as required. Do not receive information back about how the data was used or what the data meant. Health staff may think that their reporting is not important. As a result, future reporting may not be as reliable. District or national managers should respond to the health facilities that reported it. The purpose of the feedback is to reinforce health staff efforts to participate in the surveillance system. Another purpose is to raise awareness about certain diseases and any achievements of disease control and prevention projects in the area.

Outbreak response report: Feedback may be written, such as a monthly newsletter or it may be given orally, for example, during a monthly staff meeting. After an outbreak response has taken place, district staff who led the investigation need to prepare a report. Use a copy of the report as feedback to the health levels that reported the cases in the first place.

Information summary sheets: An information summary sheet is a report that presents data and its interpretation in a table or other graphic format. At a staff meeting, or during a supervisory visit, give a verbal report or comment about the data that were reported by the health facility during a given period of time. Display the data in a simple table. Sit with the health staff and show them the data.

## IDSR with International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005

The changes seen in a broader context with events include:

- Increased migration to cities with subsequent increases in traffic injuries, rates of non communicable diseases, and health conditions related to crowded housing
- Wider access to wireless technologies such as cellular phones and internet
- Impact of climate change on shifting disease patterns
- Increased recognition of the need for better coordination between human and animal health surveillance
- Increased interest from donor and technical partners to support surveillance and disease reduction strategies
- Heightened awareness of the importance of national core capacities for surveillance and response demonstrated by adoption of the International Health Regulations (2005).

### Adoption of IHR, 2005

The IHR entered into force on June 15, 2007. Legally binding instrument designed to help protect all States from the international spread of disease without interfering with international traffic and trade. Address the threat to international public health security and trade caused by emerging and reemerging diseases including public health emergencies of international concern.

### Current Public Health Priorities

Both communicable and non-communicable diseases remain among the leading causes of death, illness and disability in African communities. Progress has been made in the last decade towards improving national and regional capacity for effective surveillance and response, communicable diseases. Non-communicable diseases such as hypertension and diabetes are emerging threats in the Africa Region. Conditions and events such as malnutrition and maternal deaths are critical targets for national public health programs.

### The purpose of the IHR

To prevent, protect against, control and provide public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are relevant and restricted to public health risks and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade

### The Scope of IHR

The scope of IHR has been expanded from cholera, plague and yellow fever to all public health emergencies of international concern. They include those caused by infectious diseases, chemical agents, radioactive materials and contaminated food.

## Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC)

A Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) is a formal declaration by the World Health Organization (WHO). The declaration is promulgated by that body's Emergency Committee operating under International Health Regulations (IHR). This statement designates a public health crisis of potentially global reach.

### Recent PHEIC declarations

- 2009 swine flu declaration first issued in April 2009
- 2014 polio declaration second PHEIC issued in May 2014 with the resurgence of polio after its near-eradication, deemed "an extraordinary event".
- 2014 Ebola declaration issued on Friday, August 8, 2014 in response to the outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa
- 2019 Outbreak of COVID-19
- 2016 Zika virus declaration on Monday, February 1, 2016 in response to clusters of microcephaly and Guillain Barr syndrome in the Americas suspected to be associated with the ongoing outbreak of Zika virus
- 2019 Outbreak of COVID-19

### Events Required by the IHR for Reporting

Four conditions that **must** be notified to WHO: **_smallpox, poliomyelitis due to wild-type poliovirus, human influenza caused by a new subtype, SARS, COVID-19._**

Other diseases and events _may require notification_ if they are considered to be events of potential international public health concern including: **_Cholera, plague, yellow fever, VHF, other diseases that are of special national or regional concern e.g. dengue fever._** Any event of potential international public health concern including those of unknown cause or source, and those involving other events or diseases
