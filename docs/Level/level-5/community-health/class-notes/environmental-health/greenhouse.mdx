# Climate Change & Global Warming

Ms Kinoti

**Climate change**: Long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns

May be:

- Natural ‚Äì variations in the solar cycle
- Man-made‚Äîsince 1800‚Äôs; burning of fossil fuels generating greenhouse gas
  emissions.

**Greenhouse gases** that cause climate change are **_methane_** and **_carbon dioxide_** from gasoline,
coal, clearing land and forests, landfills or garbage, energy, industry, transport, buildings,
agriculture and land use

## Global warming

The long-term heating of the Earth‚Äôs climate system

- Occurs because of greenhouse gases e.g. Co2-gases in the atmosphere that cause the earth to
  trap and retain an excess amount of the sun‚Äôs energy causing overall air and water
  temperature to rise
- Thickening of the atmosphere mimics a blanket ‚Äìthus keeps warm
- Interchangeably used with the term climate change
- Has been observed since the pre-industrial period (1850- 1900)
- Caused by human activity, primary fossil fuel burning, that increase heat-trapping greenhouse
  gas. Level in the earths atmosphere
- Since Pre-industrial period human activity has increased Earth‚Äôs global average temperature
  by 0.8¬∞ C; this is increasing to 0.2¬∞C per decade (1.0 ¬∞ C mark was reached by 2017)
- Thus human influence has contributed to warming the atmosphere, ocean and land

### Main causes of global warming

1. Variations in the intensity of the sun

The sun is the main source of heat for the earth.
Average energy from the sun has remained constant since 1750‚Äôs. It is however
thought that there have been variations that have resulted to global warming

2. Industrial activity

Since industrial revolution, fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum
has been burnt for energy. Result in release of Co2 into the atmosphere. Part for heat
and electricity, and other part for industrial processes and transportation (cars, trucks,
trains airplanes). The other use of energy is for other purposes like agriculture,
cement production, oil and gas production. Processes also produce other greenhouse
gases like methane and CFC‚Äôs

3. Agricultural activity

For food production but also a contributor of climate change.
Use of both commercial and organic fertilizers releases nitrous oxide, methane from
natural sources but also from digestive systems of livestock and decomposition of
waste in landfills and burning of biomass

4. Deforestation

Creation of feedlots in otherwise forested areas. Logging for wood and
paper and clearing for food production. One mature tree absorbs 48 pounds of Co2
each year - about 3.5- 7 Billion trees are cut annually. Deforestation is responsible for
15%of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere

5. Earth‚Äôs own feedback loop

Atmosphere warming increases ability to hold more
water which is already the most abundant greenhouse gas. It creates a feedback loop
that accelerates global warming, creates more clouds and rainstorms. Ice melting at
the poles, exposing water which is less reflective than ice, water absorbs sun‚Äôs heat,
making the ocean warmer

## Effects of global warming:

###### a. Direct effects

- Rising maximum temperatures (wild fires)
- Rising minimum temperatures
- Rising sea levels (flood and hurricanes)
- Higher ocean temperature
- Increase in heavy precipitation (heavy rain and hail)
- Shrinking glaciers
- Thawing permafrost ‚Äì thick subsurface layer of soil that remain frozen
  throughout the year in polar regions

###### b. Indirect effects

- An increase in hunger and water crises ‚Äì developing countries
- Health risks through rising air temperature and heatwaves
- Economic implications of dealing with secondary damage related to climate
  change
- Increasing spread of pests and pathogens
- Loss of biodiversity due to limited adaptability and adaptability speed of flora
  and fauna
- Ocean acidification due to increased HCO3 concentrations in water as a
  consequence of increased CO2 concentrations
- The need for adaptation in all areas e.g. agriculture, energy, infrastructure,
  tourism etc.

## Mitigating against climate change

United Nation‚Äôs Six sector solution to the climate crisis. Limit the spike in temperatures to an average of 1.5¬∞ùê∂. The world requires the world to cut 30 gigatons greenhouse gas emissions annually
by 2030. 6 sectors with potential to reduce emissions enough to keep the world below the 1.5¬∞
C mark. Illustrated in the ‚Äòroadmap to carbon free future‚Äô:

### Roadmap to carbon free future

- Energy: By shifting to renewable energy and using less energy
- Industry: By embracing passive or renewable energy based heating and cooling systems, improving energy efficiency and addressing other pressing
  issues like methane leaks
- Agriculture and food waste: By reducing food loss and waste and shifting to more sustainablediets. Food get spoiled from farm to fork and switching to plant-rich diet is one of the biggest steps to reduction of greenhouse gas emission
- Nature based solutions: halting deforestation, ecosystem degradation and restoration of ecosystems. This improves air quality, bolster food and water security and shore up rural economies‚Äîthe end effect is climate resilience
- Transport: By use of electric vehicles in private and public transport,
  encourage people to walk, cycle and use other forms of non-motorized
  transport by creating safe spaces. This in turn reduces deaths from exhaust
  fumes in cities (deaths are projected to rise by more than 50% by 2030)
- Buildings and cities: projected to account for about 12.6GT of energy related
  emissions. But 70% of the urban infrastructure are needed to accommodate a
  fast growing world has not been built yet. By making cities and homes of
  tomorrow fit for low-carbon- age and by updating the existing infrastructure
  we can reduce emissions
