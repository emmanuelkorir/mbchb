# Environment Air Pollution

Mrs Mary Kinoti

## Definitions

Air pollution is the presence of undesirable material in air in quantities large enough to cause harmful effects to human beings, vegetation, property or global environment (De Nevers, 1995).

Broadly categorized into **indoor** and **outdoor air pollution** with sources that are largely different though similar in terms of characteristics and health effects.

The main outdoor air pollutants include **_suspended particulate matter(SPM), Sulphur dioxide(S0<sub>2</sub>), Nitrogen dioxide(NO,), ozone(0<sub>3</sub>), carbon monoxide(CO)_** and are mainly from vehicular and industrial emissions (UNEP 1975).

## Effects of Air pollution( Fossil and biomass based

- Reduction of immunity. Mice experiments- caused decrease in anti-viral immunity. In humans, AP exposure induced airway inflammation + increased asthmatic attack episode

- People living in high polluted areas have less salivary lysozomes

- Mortality and Morbidity. Exposure to PM10, SO2 No2 and 03 associated with death from cadio vascular and respiratory diseases WHO,(2014) -1/8 global deaths attributable to AP where in 12.2 million URTI attributable to AP.

- LBW(<2500gms at 237 weeks gestation. Highly polluted areas have more LBW neonates. Cause high proportion of newborne deaths, interfere

## Control of air pollution from stationary sources

- Use Of chimney Stacks is obsolete.
- Use of wet scrubbers
- Use of electrostatic precipitators
- Use of filters
- Use of cyclones

## Ways of reducing emmissions from mobile sources

- Use of non-motorized alternatives e.g Amsterdam etc
- Car pooling or taking a bus
- Use of cars with high fuel efficiency # Not fuel guzzlers
- Use of clean or non-polluting fuel automobiles (solar, electric)
- Use of hybrid automobiles etc
