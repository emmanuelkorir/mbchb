# Ozone layer depletion

Ms Kinoti

**Ozone layer:** this is a region in the earth’s stratosphere that contains high concentrations of
Ozone and protects the earth from the harmful ultraviolet radiations of the sun

Has the potential to absorb about 97-99% of harmful ultra violet radiations from the sun that can
damage life on earth.

Scientist discovered a hole in the Antarctica caused by cholorofluorocarbons,
carbon tetrachloride, methyl bromide and hydrochlorofluorocarbons. CFC are the most abundant
ozone- depleting substances

#### Discovery of ozone hole

Ozone hole discovered in 1987 over Antartica- record of low summer
ozone. Theory: Ozone hole has always been there with 1980 as a peaking of the 11 year
cycle- Not acceptable since there was no similarity with 1958. Smaller in 2018 than it was in 20 years
ago due to efforts to phase out CFCs

CFC Atmospheric concentration; Natural Ozone status in the stratosphere:

- Has increased overtime
- Total chlorine in the atmosphere- 0.8 ppbv (1950) and 3.5 ppbv (1990)
- CFC 11, CFC 12, CFC 113 & CC$ last many decades in the atmosphere

#### Ozone layer depletion

This is the gradual thinning of the earth’s ozone layer in the upper
atmosphere caused by release of chemical compounds containing bromine or chlorine from industries
and other human activities. Bromine and chlorine atoms in the atmosphere come into contact with
ozone and destroy the ozone molecules (one chlorine molecule can destroy up to 100,000 ozone
molecules). It is destroyed faster than it is created. Ozone depleting substances (ODS) contribute to
depletion on exposure to high UV light

## Causes of ozone layer depletion

###### CFC’s

Main cause of ozone layer depletion. Main cause of ozone layer depletion. Released
by solvents, spray aerosols, refrigerators, air conditioners etc. CFC molecules are broken
down by UV radiations and release chlorine atoms. The atoms react with ozone and destroy it.

OD is caused by the release of chemical compounds containing gaseous chlorine or bromine
from industry and other human activities. OD synthesized in 1990’s. Were widely used in refrigerators. Used in manufacturing of foam. Make aerosols. Cleaners of electronics as they dissolve grease. Used in making firemen’s
clothes because they have not flammable

###### Chlorine depletion chemistry in the atmosphere

CFCs in the stratosphere absorb high E Uv radiation and decompose with release of atomic
chlorine `CCl2F2 + Uv —— Cl + CClF2`

CL combines with Ozone in a few seconds to form two diatomic molecules `CL+O3 —— CLO +O2`

The ClO producedis chemically reactive and reacts with atomic oxygen to release
atomic chlorine `CLO +O —— Cl +O2`

Atomic oxygen is abundant in the upper stratosphere between 30-50Km altitude and this
reaction occurs within two minutes during the sunlight part of the day.

Other CCIF 2 product fragmentin is soon turned loose by further chemical reactions and
gets into the chain reaction.

The Cl chain reaction continues until it precipitates as HCL. One CL can destroy a 100,000
molecules of ozone before precipitating as HCL

###### Unregulated rocket launches

Research show that the launches result in depletion of ozone
layer If not controlled, it result into huge loss of the ozone layer by 2050

###### Nitrogenous compounds

E.g.NO2, NO, N2O are highly responsible for depletion of the ozone layer

###### Natural causes

E.g. sun-spots and stratospheric winds. It however doesn’t cause more than 1-
2% of ozone layer. Volcanic eruptions are also responsible for depletion

## Effects of ozone layer depletion

###### Effects on Human Health

- Exposure to harmful UV radiations of the sun
- Might result to serious health issues like skin diseases, cancers, sunburns, cataract, quick
  aging and weakening of the immune system, genetic and immune system damage

###### Effects on animals

- Direct exposure to UV radiations leads to skin and eye cancers in animals
  Effects on the environment
- Strong UV rays May lead to minimum growth, flowering and photosynthesis in forest are also
  affected by UV rays. It reduced crop productivity. May lead to loss of terrestrial and aquatic
  organisms

###### Effects on Marine Life

- Planktons are affected by exposure to harmful UV rays. This affects the order in the food
  chain.

## Solutions to ozone layer depletion

- Avoid use of ODS eg CFC in refrigerators and air conditioners and replacing the halon based
  fire extinguishers
- Minimize use of vehicles; they emit GHG that cause global warming and ozone layer
  depletion
- Use Eco friendly cleaning products most constrain chlorine and bromine. Eco- friendly
  cleaning are the best to protect the environment
- Use of nitrous oxides should be prohibited; governments should ban use of nitrous oxides and
  use minimized at individual level

###### Summary in questions

i. Which layer of the atmosphere contains ozone(O3)

ii. what is ozone depletion?

iii. Describe the process of ozone depletion

iv. Why does ozone occur more intensely at the temperate regions

v. Is reparation of ozone possible? In short or long term? Justify your response?

vi. How can can we mitigate against or minimize ozone depletion locally and globally.?
