# Environmental Risk Assessment

Ms Kinoti

**Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA)** is done to determine extent of environmental toxicology. Developed as a management tool to aid in making environmental decisions. Estimates risk of producing new product, releasing a pesticide or effluent into the environment, etc. May not be scientific—assessment endpoints are often set by societal perceptions and values

### Purpose of ERA

- Purpose is to enable risk managers to make informed environmental decisions.
- Conducted to transform scientific data into meaningful information about the risk of human
  activities to the environment.

## Framework for Environmental Risk Assessment

Previously risk assessment was seen only as hazard assessment and fate of pollutant. But above not easily separated in ecological systems à when released, chemical starts to change ecosystem while ecosystem is changing chemical

Need to go beyond and predict probability of ecological effects of chemical or action. Interaction among risk assessors, risk managers, and interested parties all phases of an ERA is critical to ensure that the results can be used to support a management decision. Because of the diverse expertise required (especially in complex ecological risk assessments), risk assessors and risk managers frequently work in multidisciplinary teams.

### Schematic of Framework

ERA includes three primary phases:

1. Problem formulation
2. Analysis
3. Risk characterization

## Outline of Phases of an ERA

### 1. Problem formulation

- Beginning of dialogue between risk managers and risk assessors.
- Selection of assessment endpoints (what is important?)
- Risk assessors evaluate goals
- Prepare the conceptual model
- Develop an analysis plan.

### 2. Analysis phase;

- Assessors evaluate exposure to stressors and the relationship between stressor levels
  and ecological effects.

### 3. Risk characterization;

- Assessors estimate risk through integration of exposure and stressor- response
  profiles,
- Describe risk by discussing lines of evidence and determining ecological adversity,
  and prepare a report.

## 1. Problem formulation

- Start of iterative process of defining the question under consideration
- Directly affects the scientific validity and policy-making usefulness of the ERA
- Composed of several six subunits

###### a) Discussion between risk assessor and risk manager

- Sets boundaries created by societal goals and scientific reality (data)
- Consolidates ambiguous goals; Protection of endangered species, Protection of
  fishery, Preserve structure and function of ecosystem

###### b) Stressor characteristics?

- Can be biological, physical, chemical
- Characterized by; intensity (conc. or dose), duration, frequency, timing (Temporal
  aspects)
- Scale (Spatial aspect)

###### c) Ecosystems Potentially at Risk?

- Difficult to address—-transport often difficult to predict
- Need to look at: Abiotic-biotic factors, History, Size, Geographic relationships

###### d) Environmental Effects

- Includes any impact upon any level of environment/ecosystem
- Derived from hazard assessment (acute/chronic toxicity) and consideration of: - Bio-transformations - Biodegradation - Reproductive effects - Predator-prey interactions - Production - Community biomass - Anything which has a direct role in the functioning of the
  environment/ecosystem

###### e) Endpoint selection

- Most critical aspect of problem formulation—- sets stage for remainder of process
- Two types of endpoints - Assessment endpoints; Set by environmental/ecological relevance, policy
  goals/societal values (i.e. protect ecosystem structure/function). Often can
  only infer from measurement endpoints - Measurement endpoints; Measurable factors that respond to stressors and
  describe characteristics of environmental/ecosystem important to assessment
  endpoints. Design and selection based on relevance, practicality, etc.

###### f) Conceptual Model

- Framework into which data are placed
- Defines how data will be interpreted (what is likely to be affected: Migratory birds?
  Temporary pond amphibians? Etc.

**Note:** all above subject to revision based on collected information from data
acquisition, verification, monitoring (DVM)

## 2. Analysis

- Comes into play as problem formulation is completed
- Most important part—-characterization of ecosystem(s) of concern
- Composed of five sub- units

###### 1. Ecosystem Characterization

- Often difficult to perform because;
  - Ecosystem no longer there?
  - Boundaries?
  - Climate changes?
  - Biotic interactions?

###### 2. Stressor characteristics and evaluation of relevant effects

- Chemical properties?
- Toxicity?
- Usually evaluate from published data
- May do own tests but expensive—-only do if absolutely necessary

###### 3. Exposure Analysis

- Determine environmental concentration
- Determine— end of pipe—biotransformation—media— heterogenecity— now how
  much toxic stuff is there?
- Non-point sources can be even more difficult
- Where to measure?
- When to measure?

###### 4. Ecological response analysis

- Most difficult stage of ERA because as test system becomes more environmentally
  realistic the ability to accurately predict effects decreases
- Can use:
  - Toxicity data
  - Microcosms
  - Field data/observations Etc.

###### 5. Stressor/response analysis

- Analogous to dose/response but using single species toxicity to extrapolate to
  population/community level responses
- Have to take other (natural) stressors into account Note: DVM critical for best results

## 3. Risk Characterization; Final stage of an ERA

Combines ecological effect and environmental concentration to provide likelihood of effects given
distribution of stressor within ecosystem

Composed of two parts:

###### 1. Risk estimation

Integration:

- Integrate exposure with toxicity
- Use quotient method of estimating environmental risk

Uncertainty analysis – how much confidence (certainty) in data/information

- Can have formal mathematical analysis or informal “best guess” analysis

Quotient Method; Quotient = (Expected environmental concentration) divided by
(Concentration producing an unacceptable environmental effect)
Quotient and Risk

- > 1: Potential of high risk
- ~1: Potential risk
- << 1: Low risk

###### 2. Risk description

Ecological risk summary

- “what are the potential effects and do I believe them?
- Interpretation of ecological significance
- “how big a problem is this really going to be”

Discussion between Risk Assessor and Risk Manager

- Report from risk assessor to risk manager
- Risk manager may take information and perform a risk/benefit analysis
- Report from risk assessor to risk manager
- Risk manager may take information and perform a risk/benefit analysis—- is the economic
  benefit worth the environmental cost?
- Report may generate multiple vituperative displays of acrimony among interested parties

Risk Management

- Manage risk taking environmental, social, economic effects into account
- Management usually implemented in the form of policy and legislation

Monitor Results

- Usually need to implement an on- going monitoring plan to determine if management
  objectives are being met.
- Often not performed as extensively as necessary until a problem arises
