## Environmnental Pollution

When Harmful Substances Contaminate the environment it is Called Pollution.It can be defined as any undesirable change in the physical, chemical, biological characteristics of any component of the environment which can cause harm to life and property.

Types of Pollution:

- Air
- Water
- Marine
- Thermal
- Soil
- Noise
- Nuclear

Atmosphere: is the life blanket of earth(thermosphere, mesosphere, stratosphere, troposphere)

## Air pollution

Air supplies us with oxygen which is essential for our bodies to live. Air is a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, carbon dioxide and inert gases. Human activities can release substances into the air, some of which can cause problems to humans, plants, and animals.

Natural Composition of Gases:

- Nitrogen 78.1%
- Oxygen 20.9%
- Argon 0.9%
- Carbon dioxide 0.035%
- Others 0.065% (neon,helium,krypton,hydrogen,xenon,ozozne,radon)

## Air pollution

An atmospheric condition in which certain substances (including normal constituents in excess) are present in concentrations which can cause undesirable effects on man and his environment.They are in the form of gases (Nox, Sox, CO,VOC); Particulate matter(dust, smoke, fumes, etc) & Radioactive (rado-222, Iodine-131, etc)

Sources of Air Pollution:

1. Natural-volcanic eruptions,forest fires,sea salt sprays,biological decay,pollen grains,marshes,photochemical oxidation of terpens
2. Anthropogenic(human activities)-thermal power plants,vehicular emissions,industrial units

Sources of emission of air pollutatants

Industry 52%, transportation 27%, consumer and commercial products 8%, commercial and residential heating 1%, agriculture 10%, other 2%

### Classification of Air Pollutants

Air pollutants may be particulate or gaseous. On the basis of origin they are divided as:

- Primary pollutants-are emitted directly from the point source. e.g.CO, NO2, SO2
- Secondary pollutants-formed by interaction of primary pollutants e.g.PAN, Smog, Ozone etc

### Criteria of Pollutants

### Indoor air pollution

Many people spend large portion of time indoors - as much as 80-90% of their lives. We work, study, eat, drink and sleep in enclosed environments where air circulation may be restricted. Children, women more exposed to risk.Radon gas (naturally occurring radioactive gas)- when inhaled, get to the lungs, exposing to small amounts of radiation,this damages the cells in the lining of the lung, thus increase person’s risk of lung cancer.Burning of dung cakes for fuel, wood, kerosene.Incomplete combustion produces CO.Cigarette smoke.

### Effects of Air Pollution

Affects Human health, Animals, Plants, Materials and Environment

#### Effect on Human health:

- Main problems are related to Respiratory Track: Asthma, hay fever, and other allergic diseases.
- Irritation of the eye, nose and throat. In severe cases there may be headaches, nausea, and loss of coordination
- prolonged exposure can cause damage to the nervous system, digestive problems, and in some cases cause Lung cancer.
- It lowers our resistance to colds and pneumonia.
- CO has affinity towards Hb which cause disturbance in transportation of Oxygen, impairing our concentration, slow our reflexes, and make us confused and sleepy.
- SO2 in the air leads to diseases of the lung and other lung disorders such as wheezing and shortness of breath.
- Chronic respiratory disease, lung cancer, heart disease, and even damage to the brain, nerves, liver, or kidneys.
- Effects of Arsenic, Asbestos, Mercury , Benzene etc.

#### Effect on Plant

- Pollutants enter through stomata
- Destroy chlorophyll and Affect photosynthesis
- Cuticle (Wax Layer on Leaves) is lost
- Necrosis – Damage to Leaf Structure
- Chlorosis - Loss/ reduction of Chlorophyll
- Abscission - Dropping of leaf
- Epinasty – Downward curling of Leaf
- Death

#### Effect on Animals and materials

- Corrosion of metal surfaces, fading
- SO2 & water form H2S – corrosion as well as disfigurement of statues made up of limestone or Marble
- Air pollutants mix with rain water and increase acidity (Acid Rain) of water body and kill fish.
- Ozone causes crackling of rubber

#### Effect on Environment

- Visibility
- Pollutants in the presence of sunlight produce photochemical Smog
- Emission of Green House Gases tend to Global Warming
- CFC’s cause Ozone Depletion

## National Ambient Air Quality Standards

| Pollutant & Time Weighted Average                 | Industrial area     | Residential area   | Sensitive area     |

Annual Average : Annual Arithmetic Mean of minimum 104 measurements in a year taken twice a week 24-hourly at uniform interval 24 Hours Average : 24-hourly/8-hourly values should be met 98% of the time in a year. However 2% of the time, it may exceeded but not two consecutive days.The levels of air quality necessary with an adequate margin of safety, to protect the public health, vegetation and property.Whenever and wherever two consecutive values exceeds the limit specified above for the respective category, it shall be considered adequate, reason to institute regular / continuous monitoring and further investigations. high volume sampler,gaseous samplers

## Control Of Air Pollution

- Proper air pollution control devices in industries
- Using low sulphur coal
- Regular engine tune up, replacement of old more polluting vehicles
- Using mass transport system, bicycles etc
- Shifting to less polluting fuels
- Planting more trees
- No to FIRE CRACKERS in any occasion

## NATIONAL AIR QUALITY MONITORING PROGRAMME (NAMP)

- A Central Pollution Control Board is necessary for executing a nation-wide programme of ambient air quality monitoring dubbed National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP).
- Under N.A.M.P., four air pollutants viz ., Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Oxides of Nitrogen as NO2, Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) and Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM / PM10) need to be identified for regular monitoring at across the country.
- The monitoring of meteorological parameters such as wind speed and wind direction, relative humidity (RH) and temperature need also to be integrated with the monitoring of air quality.

## Water Pollution

The Contamination of water with undesirable substances which make it unfit for usage is termed water Pollution.
Pollution Sources:

- Point sources are direct discharges to a single point; examples include discharges from sewage treatment plants, injection wells and some industrial sources.
- Non-point sources are diffused across a broad area and their contamination cannot be traced to a single discharge point. Examples include runoff of excess fertilizers, herbicides, and insecticides from agricultural lands and residential areas; oil, grease, and toxic chemicals from urban runoff and energy production; and sediment from improperly managed construction sites, crop and forest lands, and eroding stream banks.

### Surface Water Pollution

Sewage, Industrial effluents, Synthetic detergents, Agrochemicals, Oil, Waste heat

#### Domestic Sewage:

Refers to waste water that is discarded from households. Also referred to as sanitary sewage, such water contains a wide variety of dissolved and suspended impurities. It is large by volume and contains impurities such as organic materials and plant nutrients that tend to rot. The main organic materials are food and vegetable waste, plant nutrient come from chemical soaps, washing powders, etc. Domestic sewage is also very likely to contain disease-causing microbes.

#### Industrial Effluents:

Waste water from manufacturing or chemical processes in industries. Industrial waste water usually contains specific and readily identifiable chemical compounds. Mainly in the form of toxic wastes and organic pollutants. Chromium, mercury, lead, copper, cadmium etc

#### Synthetic Detergents And Oils:

Added because of washing clothes, cleaning utensils. In industries for washing. Add surfactants and soaps to water. Toxic to fish, aquatic life. Oceans are polluted by oil on a daily basis fan. The rest come from shipping travel, drains and dumping.

#### Agricultural Run Off:

Routine applications of fertilizers and pesticides for agriculture and uncontrolled run off in water bodies. Addsrom oil spills, routine shipping, run-offs and dumping. Oil spills make up about 12% of the oil that enters the oce Nitrogen and Phosphorus to water. Causes Eutrophication and algal blooms. Nitrate concentration is above the permissible level of 45 ppm in 11 states, covering 95 districts and 2 blocks of Delhi.

### Ground Water Pollution:

Is less comparatively as soil acts as a filter Still: Septic tanks, Mining, Deep well injection, Presence of heavy metals in groundwater is an important element for pollution control studies. Examples include Mercury, Cadmium, Manganese etc, Arsenic , Nitrate, Fluoride

#### Fluoride Poisoning:

The incidence of fluoride above permissible levels of 1.5ppm occur in many parts of Kenya: Some other estimates find that a large percentage of Kenya’s population is exposed to fluoride risk. Fluoride Poisoning: A recent survey by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) in north Gujarat showed 42 per cent of the people covered in the sample survey (28,425) were affected; while 25.7 per cent were affected by dental fluorosis, 6.2 per cent were affected by muscular skeletal fluorosis and 10 per cent by both. Fluoride had been reported to cause depressions in DNA and RNA synthesis in cultured cells. Another study on the effects of fluorides in mice showed significant reductions in DNA and RNA levels. Conditions including aging, cancer, and arteriosclerosis are associated with DNA damage and its disrepair.

#### Arsenic Poisoning:

High levels of arsenic above the permissible levels of 50 parts per billion (ppb) are found in the alluvial plains of Kenya. Arsenic contamination of drinking water causes a disease called arsenicosis, for which there is no effective treatment. Arsenic contamination is by far the biggest mass poisoning case in the world putting 200 million people at risk though some other estimates put the figure at 360 million people globally.

## Effects Water Pollution:

- Depletion of dissolved oxygen
- Eutrophication
- Pathogen….spreading diseases
- Bio-magnification
- Genetic deformities
- Blue baby Syndrome
- Minamata disease
- Carcinogens causing cancers

### Depletion of dissolved oxygen

- Low DO
- Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)
- Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)
- Biodegradable and organic waste leads to Oxygen depletion
- DO levels less than 4 mg / l disastrous.
- Polluted waters have 0 DO

### Pathogen spreading diseases:

Stagnant water and other untreated water provide a habitat for the mosquito and a host of other parasites and insects that cause a large number of diseases especially in the tropical regions. Among these, malaria is undoubtedly the most widely distributed and causes most damage to human health.

### Bio-magnification

Biomagnification occurs if a pollutant such as DDT,mercury or a PCB,is picked up by an organism and is not broken down or eliminated from its body.Instead, the pollutant collects in body tissues.

- Pesticides. The organophosphates and the carbonates present in pesticides affect and damage the nervous system and can cause cancer. Some of the pesticides contain carcinogens that exceed recommended levels. They contain chlorides that cause reproductive and endocrinal damage.
- Lead is hazardous to health as it accumulates in the body and affects the central nervous system. Children and pregnant women are most at risk.
- Petrochemicals. Benzene and other petrochemicals can cause cancer even at low exposure levels.
- Chlorinated solvents are linked to reproduction disorders and to some cancers.
- Other heavy metals: Heavy metals cause damage to the nervous system and the kidney, and other metabolic disruptions.

### Case Study of Vultures

Veterinary use of the drug diclofenac—used in the treatment of livestock—has been linked to the collapse of vulture populations throughout South Asia. Vultures are keystone species that perform a vital ecosystem service by disposing of carrion and their decline has had dramatic ecological and socio-economic consequences. Vultures feeding on the carcasses of animals recently treated with the drug suffer renal failure and die.

### Blue baby Syndrome

Blue Baby Syndrome or Methemoglobinemia is caused by decreased ability of blood to carry oxygen, resulting in oxygen deficiency in different body parts. Infants are more susceptible than adults. The disease can be caused by intake of water and vegetables high in nitrate, exposure to chemicals containing nitrate, or can even be hereditary. As different parts of the body get deprived of oxygen, clinical symptoms of oxygen starvation start to appear, the main being cyanosis (derived from ‘cyano’, meaning dark blue; from Greek, kyanos).The lips or even the skin start to take on a blue colouration, hence the common name, the blue baby syndrome/ disease.

### Minamata disease

First detected in the 50’s (1952-1956). In Minamata, Japan, mercury was used in the industrial production of acetaldehyde. Discharged into the nearby bay and was ingested by organisms. Fish and other creatures in the sea were soon contaminated and eventually residents of this area who consumed the fish suffered from MeHg (methyl mercury) intoxication.

### ITAI-ITAI

Itai-itai disease ("ouch ouch sickness"), Was the documented case of mass cadmium poisoning in Toyama Prefecture, Japan, starting around 1912. The cadmium poisoning caused softening of the bones and kidney failure. The disease is named for the severe pains (Japanese: itai) caused in the joints and spine. The cadmium was released into rivers by mining companies. This Cadmium contaminated water was used to irrigate rice fields.

## Control of Water Pollution

- Treatment of wastewater before discharging into surface or underground water bodies.
- Restoration of polluted water bodies.
- EMS Action Plan
- River Water Monitoring

## Marine Pollution

Marine Pollution is caused due to Sewage Sludge, Industrial Effluents, Detergents, solid waste, plastic, etc. Sources : River- Bring pollutants from drainage basins, Catchment Area- Human Settlements, Oil Drilling & Shipment

Effects : Aquatic mortality, oil disrupts the insulating capacity of feathers due to loss of buoyancy and subsequent drowning of Birds cause Deaths

Control measures

- Effluents should not be discharged
- Treatment before discharge
- Strict law enforcement- regarding drilling in Ecosensitive zones, dumping of toxic & Hazardous wastes
- Minimum developmental activities on shore
- CRZs: Coastal regulation Zones

## Thermal Pollution

Presence of waste heat in the water which can cause undesirable changes in natural environment.

Causes: Heat producing Industries, Power plants utilize only 1/3rd energy produced by fossil fuel rest is wasted as heat, Cold water is taken from water body for cooling used and left in the water body back with increase of 10-15 Deg.

Effects:

- Oxygen penetration decreases, dissolved oxygen also reduces as the solubility is decreased
- Heat kills fishes and other aquatic life.
- Toxicity of pesticides & chemicals increase with increase in temperature
- Metabolic Activities increase at high temp. requiring more oxygen.
- Spawning is disturbed
- Fish migration is affected
- Composition of flora & fauna changes
- Temp. tolerant spp. Start developing
- Control of Thermal pollution: Cooling ponds, cooling towers and spray ponds

## Noise pollution

Unwanted and unbearable sound is “Noise”. Sound travels in form of pressure waves through air, liquid or solid. Measured on DECIBEL SCALE. Maximum during Diwali, Ganpati and other festivals. Higher in Industrial area. 80 to 120 dB. Crackers: 125 dB Construction: 100 dB.

Sources and effects: Transportation, Heavy Machinery, Construction activities, Celebrations and household appliances, Physiological and psychological changes, Interferes communication, Hearing damage, Sleep disturbance.

Noise standards: Night 10 p.m. to morning 6 a.m: loud noise banned. Declaration of Zones.

Permissible db levels:

| Area           | Day time    | Night time  |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|                | 6am to 10pm | 10pm to 6am |
| a) Industrial  | 75dB        | 70dB        |
| b) Commercial  | 65dB        | 55dB        |
| c) Residential | 55dB        | 45dB        |
| Silence zone   | 50dB        | 40dB        |

Control:

- Reduction at the source
- Proper maintenance of machineries
- Machineries should be covered
- Use of sound absorbing silencers
- Through law
- Planting more trees of broad leaves

## Nuclear or Radioactive hazard pollution

Natural radioactive decay. Give out fast moving particles, high energy radiations. Alpha and beta particles. Nuclear accidents, test laboratories radioactive fallout. Fukushima in Japan. Pripyat in Ukraine

Effects and control:

- Genetic damage : DNA alterations, gene damage, chromosome damage
- Somatic damage: Burns, miscarriages, eye cataract, cancers of skin, bones, breast.
- Proper siting.
- Proper disposal.

## Soil pollution

Soil is upper layer of earth crust, contains organic matter, fertile. Dumping of wastes causes soil pollution. Garbage. Rubbish like glass, plastics, metallic cans, papers, cloth rags, containers. Discharge of Industrial wastes. Fly ash from Thermal power plants. Fertilizers and pesticides: DDT, endrin, Lindane. Sewage sludge and radioactive wastes

Effects and control:

- Reduce soil productivity
- Affects soil flora and fauna
- Sludge contains worms, bacteria and pathogens.
- Radioactive wastes enter food chain:Strontium 90 mimics calcium.
- Treatment before discharge: Convert waste to biogas, fuel etc, Recover from soil.

## Solid waste

Higher standards of living generate more waste. Quantities are enormous. Management is very important. Sources of solid waste include: Waste from homes, hospitals, industries, parks, gardens, shops, construction and demolition waste. In each and every action of humans, Solid waste is generated.

Two types of Waste:

- BIODEGRADABLE: Vegetable waste, Food waste, Tea leaves, Egg shells, Dry leaves
- NON- BIODEGRADABLE: Polythene bags, Glass bottles, Scrap metal, Tins, cans etc etc, Electronic waste

EFFECTS OF SOLID WASTE: Waste heap up on roads , litter surroundings, foul smells, vector breeding. BURNING produces toxic gases

Management: Following methods in use: composting, sanitary landfill, incineration, segregation of waste.
