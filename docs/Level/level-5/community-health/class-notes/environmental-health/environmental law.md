# Environment Legistlation

Ms Kinoti

Environmental characteristics and changes influence human health. The inter-relationship between environment and MDGs demonstrates that environment is a key factor to good health.

For desirable human health outcomes, ecosystem health requires to be enhanced in totality.

This is important in view of the fact that the environment constitutes the foundation of national economic, social, cultural and spiritual advancement.
