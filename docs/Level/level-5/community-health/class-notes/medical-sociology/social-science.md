# Social Science & Health

Prof. Olenja Joyce

## Relevance of Social Science in Health

Encompasses various set of disciplines. Most relevant to health are: psychology (clinical mental health), anthropology (medical), sociology (medical- organization of services), demography/population studies (medical), health economics, polital economy of health- distribution and provision of health services, health education.

## Social science & health

Focus on social determinants of health. Focus on International health problems and programs in a social perspective- the interaction of the broader political and socio-economic contexts. Consider the interface between clinical and social components of human health. This approach has dominated the public health movement and is key to the PHC concept: focus on prevention and health promotion, focus on the role of the community. In line with the WHO definition that: _Health is the “physical, mental, spiritual, psychological and social well-being and not just the absence of disease of infirmity.”_

### Health & the casual web

The need for a holistic approach to health. Allows for the integrative analysis of health , disease and care seeking. This takes into account both social and health sciences. Each of the components help to decipher the contributors to disease causation and maintenance of health. Recognizes the role of man/community in this process

### The holistic approach

Taking man and health as the core.
Interaction with the physical environment & the social environment. Influence of Culture. Influence of external factors.

### Why medical sociology/anthropology?

**_Sociology:_** Human organization, social interactions, organization and delivery of services(hierarchical) based on status and roles.

**_Anthropology:_** Broadly – the Study of man in terms of culture- belief system and practices

Sociology and anthropology have a shared focus on human organization, behavior and practices. They share qualitative approaches in the study of the community understanding of health and disease/illness. **_Socio-economic and cultural factors_** are prime determinants of health and healthcare service deliver.

#### Medical anthropology & epidemiology

Takes a holistic perspective(physical , social and cultural environments). Focuses on social attributes and biological susceptibility. Focuses on populations rather than individuals.

## Approaches/explanatory models in health & disease

Although health and disease are _universal concepts_, they are also largely _cultural constructs._ These constitutes two explanatory models:

1. Biomedical model
2. Cultural model

### Biomedical model

Based on the developments/research in the natural sciences. There is Shared Science objectivity. There is a separation between individual thoughts and what is real in the universe outside ourselves(Science). Science as knowledge is part of a reality that is separate and independent of individuals and can be verified through scientific method. The world can be discovered objectively through observation and measurement that is considered unbiased. Study of Medicine is _objective._
Illnesses or disease is explained in impersonal and systemic terms. There is the application of the germ theory. Causes and cure/management are either known or increasingly sought for(through research on a continuous basis). Example: HIV and other conditions for which there is no known cure. (And now COVID-19).
This is the cornerstone of modern medicine. It is the universal perspective – Also referred to as the **_ETIC perspective/ approach to health and disease_**. ETIC- Outsider- objective/Independent view.

## What is culture?

A belief system of any given community. Shared knowledge based on socialization. Identifiable practices that may be unique to the community. Defines communities.
Important: Culture is amenable to change over time due to internal or external influence
For example COVID-19 has influenced some cultural practices- i.e Burial ceremonies- we may not go back to the past

It is about Individuals/local communities. Individuals create their own subjective realities. These are the lenses through which the world is known and through these ideas we come to know and define the world. It is about an individual’s ideas and perception of the world.

## Cultural model

Illness and health largely perceived as cultural phenomena. Based on cultural ideas of disease causation that are largely personalistic/localized. Explanation of causation and labeling are engendered in culture – e.g. attribution of ill health to witchcraft, the evil eye, taboos and transgression (example of child malnutrition and HIV/AIDS in selected communities  
supernatural forces leads to (fatalism and resignation).

Ill-health is experienced in a way that is influenced by prevailing cultural ideas. Whether an illness is regarded as serious or harmless can vary from one culture to another. Such ideas affect how the patient experiences the illness episode and the subsequent response.

Also referred to as and **_EMIC perspective_** - reflects the views of an **_INSIDER_**. Views/Perspectives make sense within a given culture
Some of the cultural practices- i.e FGM only make sense and have MEANING for certain cultural groups. The views appear irrational to the outsider.

### Beyond culture

An important point to note is that although culture plays a great role in disease causation we should not lose site of the role of :

- socio-economic factors such as people’s living and working conditions (environment, gender, changing lifestyle, poverty and access to health services)

### Importance of context

- Imperative to view/study community health in context by employing an **_emic (insider approach)._**

  _(What are their beliefs and practices relating to health and ill-health?)_

- Reduces stereotyping and blaming the victim.
- Fosters cultural relativism versus ethnocentricity
- Allows one to decipher how people view their own situation and how they solve their problems
- Appreciating the inside view (perception, meaning) sets the stage/basis for appropriate interventions
