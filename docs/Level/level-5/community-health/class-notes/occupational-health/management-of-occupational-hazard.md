# Management of Occupational Hazard

Ms Karimi

## Classification of work place occupational hazards

1. Biological Hazards e.g blood borne & infectious agents
2. Chemical Hazards e.g Acids/alkalis, glues, pesticides etc
3. Physical Hazards e.g noise, glare
4. Safety Hazards e.g Moving machines
5. Ergonomic Hazards e.g Improperly adjusted workstations and chairs, frequent lifting, Poor posture, repetitive movements, Vibration etc
6. Psychosocial/stress hazards e.g Excessive workloads, Conflicting demands and lack of role clarity, Lack of involvement in making decisions that affect the worker and lack of influence over the way the job is done, Poorly managed organizational change, job insecurity, Ineffective communication, lack of support from management or colleagues Psychological and sexual harassment, third party violence

## Biological Hazards

Any risk that comes from the biosphere – people, plants, and animals – can be considered biological hazards. Some examples of biological hazards are: e.g Mold and Fungi,Blood and Body Fluids, Sewage, Airborne pathogens such as the common cold, Stinging insects, Harmful plants, Animal and Bird Droppings.

### Questions to ask about biological hazards exposure when assessing your workplace.

> Are employees working around other people who may have a contagious disease or sickness?
> Do my employees work with or around animals and insects?
> Is the workspace clean and clear of mold and fungi?
> Will my employees be working around potentially hazardous pathogens or biological materials such as sewage? If my employees are around biological hazards, do they have the proper protective equipment to be safe?
> Are there any “sharp” materials that need to be cleaned regularly and properly and/or disposed of safely and securely?

## Administrative vs. Engineering Controls (BH)

- Engineering controls reduce risk through physical means e.g regular cleaning of the workplace, pest prevention/extermination, wearing of PPE, proper disposal of materials and items that may pose a biological risk.
- Administrative controls reduce risk by change of work processes and activities to make them more safe e.g allowing proper sick leave to employees, providing immunization programs, and limiting exposure to potential biological safety hazards by shifts compulsory annual leave and training staff to work safely around them
- Employees should not work alone ---out os site of others or mgt inase of need for help Prevention and control of chemical hazards at a work place. This methodology has four phases.

These four phases are;

1. Identify
2. Assess
3. Control
4. Sustain

- Prevention and control of Occupational physical hazards E,g noise
- Control of the noise source (Engineering option, substitution etc,)
- Control of the noise propagation (Administrative-Isolate the source, change processes
- Control at the worker level(issue PPE, Educate, training etc

## Requirements for Hazard Prevention and Control Strategies

- Political will and decision-making
- Commitment from top management, with a clear and well circulated policy basis
- Commitment from workers
- Well defined goals and objectives
- Adequate human and financial resources
- Technical knowledge and experience
- Adequate implementation and competent management of programmes
- Establishment of multidisciplinary teams
- Mechanisms for communication
- Monitoring mechanisms (indicators)
- Continuous improvement of the programme. “Decision-making ladder” can be used to analyze the decision-making process concerning hazard control in workplaces, as well as to pinpoint where blockages occurred, or are likely to occur, with a view to avoiding them.

The “steps” in the ladder are:

- Be aware of the problem
- Accept the problem
- Know the cause
- Learn of possible solutions
- Evaluate
- Accept a solution So that efficient hazard prevention
- Know the supplier (of solution)
- Finance
- Implement solutions
- Evaluate

### Prevention and control of Occupational Hazards

> Engineering controls
> Administrative controls
> Education
> Personal protective equipment

### Some of strategy/programme inputs

> Environmental surveillance  
> Health Surveillance
> Record keeping
> Continuous improvement

Take Home Learning Points:
Minimization of exposure to any occupational hazard requires several assessment methods and control measures
