be conveyed through a totally enclosed system incorporating
pipe-lines and pumps or similar appliances but where
conveyance of highly flammable liquids within a workplace
through such a totally enclosed system is not practicable, they
shall be conveyed in vessels which are so designed and
constructed as to avoid so far as practicable, the risk of
spilling.
(3)Where in any process or operation any highly
flammable liquid is liable to be spilled or to leak, all

used in the process, and by removal or prevention of
The Occupational Safety and Health Act, 2007
81
accumulation of the dust, and by exclusion or effective
enclosure of possible sources of ignition.
(2)Where there is present in any plant used in any process
referred to in subsection (1), dust of such a character and to
such an extent as to be liable to explode on ignition, then,
unless the plant is so constructed as to withstand the pressure

The Occupational Safety and Health Act, 2007
82
non-explosive or non-inflammable; and, if any plant, tank or
vessel has been subjected to any such operation, no explosive
