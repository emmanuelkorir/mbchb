# Control Measures in Occoupational Health & Safety

Kellen Karimi

Occupational health and safety is the science of Recognition, Evaluation and Control of health hazards in the working environment, 1.e. biological, chemical, physical and ergonomic/mechanical hazards

All workplace hazards (chemical, physical etc) can be controlled by a variety of methods

Goal of controlling hazards is to prevent workers from exposure
Most effective method of controlling hazards is to control at the source by eliminating the hazard or by substituting hazardous agents or work process with a less dangerous one

Before thinking about what control measures are needed, the first thing to know is if there are health and safety problems in the workplace and if so, what they are

## How to identify health and safety problems

- Observe workplace

- Investigate complaints from workers

- Examine accident and near-miss records

- Examine sickness figures

- Use simple surveys to ask co-workers about health and safety concerns

- Use check-lists to help inspect workplace

- Learn results of inspections done by employer, union or anyone else

- Read reports or other information about the workplace

## Hazard control measures

A hazard control program is put in place

Program consist of all necessary steps to protect workers from exposure to a hazard

A written workplace hazard control program should outline which methods are being used to control exposure and how the controls will be monitored for effectiveness

No program is identical to the other since the control measures are designed to suit needs of an individual workplace

## Steps involved in choosing of control method

- Evaluating and selecting temporary and permanent controls

- Implementing temporary measures until permanent (engineering) controls can be put in place

Implementing permanent controls when reasonably practicable

- E.g. for noise hazards, temporary measures might require workers to use hearing protection. Longterm, permanent controls might use engineering methods to remove or isolate source of noise

## Control Measures

Measures related to the work environment

Measures related to the workers
Note: Exposure to health hazards should not exceed permissible levels

### Control Measures depend on:

- Nature of the harmful substance

- Degree of risk from exposure

- Routes of entry or absorption into the body

- Period of exposure

- Relative costs of implementation

## Main ways to control a hazard/Hierarchy of control

- Elimination: remove the hazard from the workplace.
- Substitution: Include replacing hazardous material with less hazardous
- Engineering Controls: includes designs or modifications to plants, equipment, ventilation systems, and processes that reduce the source of exposure.
- Administrative Controls: controls that alter the way the work is done, including timing of work, policies and other rules, and work practices
- Personal Protective Equipment: equipment worn by individuals to reduce exposure such as contact with hazards e.g. chemicals or exposure to noise.

These methods are also known as the "hierarchy of control" because they should be considered in the order presented (it is always best to try to eliminate the hazard first, etc)

## Range of Control Options

</div>

### 1. Elimination

Is the process of removing the hazard from the workplace. It's the most effective way to control a risk because the hazard is no longer present.

It's the preferred control method and should be used whenever possible

- May involve change of technology or proces
- Alteration so that the hazardous substance is not needed

Examples:

- Removal of absestos from acoustic ceiling tiles

### 2. Substitution

Occur when a new chemical or substance is used instead of another chemical. Its sometimes grouped with elimination because, in effect, you are removing the first substance/hazard from workplace. Goal is to choose a new chemical that is less hazardous than the original.

Goal is to choose a new chemical that is less hazardous than the original. Caution must be observed to ensure the new substitutions do not cause harmful effects, and control and monitoring of the exposures should not exceed occupational exposure limits.

Another type of substitution include using the same chemical but used in a different form e.g. dry, dusty powder may be an inhalation hazard, but if it can be used in form of pellets the dust levels can be reduced (the smaller the size of the particle, the less hazardous it is).

### 3. Engineering controls

These are methods that are built into the design of a plant, equipment or process to minimize the hazard. Are very reliable ways to control worker exposure as long as the controls are designed, used and maintained properly

Basic types of engineering controls

- Process control
- Enclosure and/or isolation of emissionsource
- Ventilation

#### a. Process control

Involve changing the way the job or activity or process is done to reduce risk

Monitoring should be done before and after implementation of the control to ensure changes lowered exposure

##### Examples of process control

- Use wet rather than wet drilling or grinding
- Use appropriate vacuum or 'wet method'instead of dry sweeping (with a broom) to control dust and reduce inhalation hazard
- Use steam cleaning instead of solvent degreasing-evaluation of potential high temperature hazards is important to avoid heat stress
- Use of electrical motors rather than diesel to eliminate diesel exhaust
- Instead of spray paints, dip paints are recommended
- Use of automation i.e. the less workers have to handle the less the risk of esposure
- Use mechanical transportation rather than manual

#### b. Enclosure and Isolation

Method aim to keep the chemical 'in' and the worker 'out' and vice versa. Enclosure keeps a selected hazard 'physically' away from worker.

Enclosed equipment e.g. is tightly sealed and is typically only opened for cleaning or maintenance

- Examples: abrassive blasting cabinets or remote control devicesCare must be taken when enclosure is opened for maintenance as exposure could occur

#### c. Ventilation

Is a method of control that strategically "adds' and 'removes' air in the work environment- can remove or dilute an air contaminant

If well designed, local exhaust ventilation is adaptable to almost all chemicals and operations. It removes contaminants at the source so that it does not disperse in the workspace- uses lower exhaust rate than general ventilation which usually exchanges air in the entire room. Local exahust ventilation is effective means of controlling workplace exposures but should be used when other methods (elimination and substitution) are not possible

## Basic parts of a local exhaust system

- A hood- captures the contaminated air at the source
- Ductwork- carries the contaminated air way from the source
- Fan- draws the air from the hood into the ducts and removes the air from workspace
- Air cleaning devices- may be present-can remove contaminants such as dust (particulates), gases and vapors from the air before it is discharged into the environment (outside air), depending on the material(s) being used in the hood

Ventilation system design is important and must match the particular process and chemical/ contaminant in use. Expert guidance should be sought. It's a very effective control measure but only if it is properly designed and maintained. Environmental air regulations or bylaws that apply should be checked since the contaminant is exhausted to the outdoors.

### 4. Administrative controls

The controls limit workers' exposure by scheduling shorter work times in contaminant areas or by implementing other rules. The measures may have limitations because the hazard itself is not actually removed or reduced

Administrative controls are not generally favored because they can be difficult to implement, maintain and are not a reliable way to reduce exposure

Examples of administrative controls

- Scheduling maintenance and other high exposure operations for times when few workers are present (evenings and weekends)
- Use of job-rotation schedules that limit amount of time an individual worker is exposed to a substance
- Using a work-rest schedule that limits the length of time a worker is exposed to a hazard

Forms of administrative controls include:

- Work practices
- Education and training
- Good housekeeping
- Personal hygiene practices and facilities

##### a. Work practices

Elements of safe work practices:

- Developing and implementing standard operating procedures
- Training and education of employees about the operating procedures and other necessary workplace training
- Establishing and maintaining good housekeeping programs
- Keep equipment well maintained
- Preparing and training for emergency response for incidents such as spills or employee injury

##### b. Education and training

- Education helps minimize risk of exposure and is a critical element of any complete workplace health and safety program
- Training must cover not only how to do the job safely but also ensure workers understand the hazards of their job
- Employee education must also provide information on how to protect themselves and co-workers

##### c. Good housekeeping

- Is essential to prevent accumualtion of hazardous or toxic material - e.g. build-up of dust or contaminants on beams, or hazardous conditions like poor stockpilling
- Prodecude minimizes contaminant dissemination through cleaning and decontamination activities
- Examples include:
- Surface cleaning (vacuum cleaning, wet mopping)
- Spill clean-up

##### d. Personal hygiene practices and facilities

An effective way of reducing amount of hazardous material absorbed, ingested or inhaled by a worker. Particularly effective if the contaminant(s) can accumulate on the skin, clothing or hair

Examples of practices:

- Washing hands after handling material before eating, drinking or smoking
  Avoid touching lips, nose and eyes with contaminated hands
- No smoking, drinking, chewing gum or eating in the work
  area
- Not storing hazardous material in the same fridge as food

5. Personal protective equipment (PPE)

PPE include items like respirators, protective clothing, gloves, face shield, eye protection, and footware that serve to provide a barrier between the wearer and chemical/hazardous material. It is the final item on the list of controls for a very good reason

PPE should never be the only method used to reduce exposure except under very specific circumstances because they may 'fail' with little or no warning

- e.g. 'breakthrough' can occur with gloves, clothing and respirator cartridges

No matter the type of PPE, a complete PPE program should be in place

## Monitoring and review of hazards control program

Important to monitor both hazard and control method to make sure that the control is working effectively and that exposure is reduce or eliminated

Some tools include:

- Physical inspection
- Testing
- Esposure assessment
- Observations
- Injury and illness tracking
- Employee feedback/input
- Occupational health assessment

## Questions to ask in the process

- Have the controls solved the problem?
- Is the risk psoed by the original hazard contained?
- Have any news hazards been created?
- Are new hazards appropriately controlled?
- Are monitoring processes adequate?
- Have workers been adequately informed about the situation?
- Are any other measures required?
- Has the effectiveness of hazard controls been documented in your committee minutes?
- What else can be done?
