Kellen Karimi

## Definition

A technical document that provide detailed and compehensive information on a controlled product. The information is about:

- Health effects of exposure​
- Hazard evaluation related to the product’s handling, storage or use​
- Measure to protect workers at risk of exposure.
- Emergency procedures incase of accident​

MSDS should be supplied with any hazardous chemical​

## Sections of the MSDS

MSDS must contain the following 16 subheadings

1.  **Identification of the substance/mixture and ID of company​**
    This include product identifier; manufacturer or distributor name, address, phone number, emergency phone number; recommended use; restrictions on use ​

4.  **First Aid measures**​
    Include important symptoms/ effects, acute, delayed; required treatment ​
5.  **Fire-fighting measures**​
    List of suitable extinguishing techniques, equipment; chemical hazards from fire ​
6.  **Accidental release measures**​
    List emergency procedures; protective equipment; proper methods of containment and cleanup​
7.  **Handling and storage​**
    List precautions for safe handling and storage, including incompatibilities​
8.  **Exposure controls/persoal protection**​
    Lists OSHA’s permissible exposure limits and threshold limit values; any other exposure used or recommended by manufacturer, importer as well as appropriate engine\*\*ering controls and PPE​
9.  **Physical and chemical porperties**​
    Lists the characteristics of the chemical- appearance, viscosity, odor, physical state, vapor pressure, boiling point, melting point, solubility in water, specific gravity​
10. **Stability and reactivity** ​
    Lists chemical stability and possibility of hazardous reactions. The stated to avoid like temperature, compartibility with other chemicals, hazardous decomposition, polymerization.
11. **Toxicological information** ​
    Includes routes of exposure; related symptoms, acute and chronic effects; numerical measures of toxicity; harmful effect of exposure​
12. **Ecological information** ​
    Lists harmful effect on the ecology; biodegradability ​
13. **Disposal consideration**​
    Special instructions in accordance with local laws e.g. if any prior treatment is required before disposal to avoid contaminating lakes, groundwater, soil.​
    Classification of waste, what to do with empty cans ​

    If other is any specification on the transport, specialized vehicles for hazardous chemicals​
15. **Regulatory information** ​
    Lists effects as stipulated OSHA regulations i.e. definitions by the regulations e.g. ‘eye irritant as difined by OSHA Hazard Communication standard​
16. **Other information**​
    Hazard ratings on health, flammability, reactivity​
