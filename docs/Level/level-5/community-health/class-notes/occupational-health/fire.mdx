# Industrial Fire Safety & Prevention

Mrs Mary Kinoti

Fire is a process in which substances combine chemically with oxygen from the air and give out combustion/burning bright light. Fire is a chemical reaction, often between different chemical compounds or elements, each which has stored energy.

Results from combination of heat; fuel; and oxygen

History:

- 1911 New York USA 146 killed in a fire in a garment factory
- 1988 Piper Alpha UK North Sea 167 killed by a fire on an oil platform
- 1993 Nakhon Pathom Thailand 188 killed in a fire in a toy factory 2012
- Karachi Pakistan 289 killed in a fire in a garments factory

The potential for fire is always there in a working environment

Fire develops in three stages:

1. Incipient stage
2. Smoldering stage
3. Flame stage

## Classes of fire

**Class A:** Ordinary solid combustibles such as paper, wood, cloth and some plastics.

**Class B:** Flammable liquids such as alcohol, ether, oil, gasoline and grease, which are best extinguished by smothering.

**Class C:** Electrical equipment, appliances and wiring in which the use or a nonconductive extinguishing agent prevents injury from electrical shock. Don’t use water.

**Class D:** Certain flammable metallic substances such as sodium and potassium. These materials are normally not found in the Medical Center

## Fire hazards

- Electrical wiring
- Flammable and combustible Liquids and Vapors
- Potable Heaters
- Open flame(welding&cutting)
- Smoking

## Causes of fire

###### 1. Hot work

Encompasses tasks like welding, sawing and drilling — anything
that involves sparks or is a potential source for ignition. Fires and explosions can start from hot work when the sparks disperse and ignite any flammable items or substances nearby.

###### 2. Electrical

Electrical hazards occur with exposed wiring, overloaded outlets or circuits and extension cords. These instances make for easy ignition.

###### 3. Machinery

Any machinery that operates frequently or extensively can
potentially be a fire and explosion hazard. Due to the friction of moving parts in machines and operations, these items can cause fires. The elements can also jam and cause an explosion.

###### 4. Vehicles

Vehicles can run into similar fire and explosion risks as machinery. Some industrial and manufacturing vehicles break down due to poor maintenance or accidents.

###### 5. Gases & Liquids

Some gasses and liquids are inherently flammable. Things
like crude oil, rocket fuel and other toxic fluids can easily ignite in a warehouse. Gasses, too, become significantly more dangerous when in contact with a source of fire.

### Ensuring Industrial Fire safety and Prevention

Fires need 3 things to start:

1. Sources of ignition include heaters, lighting, naked flames, electrical equipment, smokers’ materials (cigarettes, matches etc.), and anything else that can get very hot or cause sparks;
2. Sources of fuel include wood, paper, plastic, rubber or foam, loose packaging materials, waste rubbish and furniture;
3. Sources of oxygen include the air around us.

## Fire Extinguishers

Fire extinguishers are classified as **_types A, ABC, BC or K_**. It is important to use the right type of extinguisher on the specific class of fire to avoid personal injury or damage to property. The wrong type of extinguisher could cause electrical shock, explosion, or spread the fire. Portable extinguishers are useful for putting out small fires but not effective against large, spreading fires

### Types of Fire Extinguishers

###### Type A

Pressurized water to be used on Class A fire only. Do not use on Class B or C fires; may cause fire spread or electrical shock.

###### Type ABC

Dry chemical effective on all classes of fires

###### Type BC

Carbon dioxide to be used on chemical or electrical fires

###### Type K:

Used in kitchens on grease fires

## Causes to failure to control fire outbreaks

- **Poor building design:** The lack of provision of fire escape routes within the design of the building, result in long dead ends, no means of escape. Often fire escape routes are only available on the ground floor of a building,
  workers may be trapped by the rising fire
- **Obstruction of the fire escape routes:** Warehouses and storage facilities are often overfilled or with poorly distributed materials, leading to an obstruction of the fire escape routes. The locking of exit doors as a measure to improve security can result in the inability to open the exit routes and lead people to become trapped in a dead end within the burning building.
- **Lack of an early warning system:** Fire early warning systems such as smoke detectors, heat detectors or flame detectors provide an effective way to detect fires rapidly in order to apply timely control measures
- **Lack of Emergency Procedure:** lack of training in those procedures and the lack of routine practices of those procedures

## Steps in Fire risk assessment:

1. Identify the fire hazards.
2. Identify people at risk eg children, disabled, pregnant women
3. Evaluate, remove or reduce the risks.
4. Record your findings, prepare an emergency plan and provide
   training.Review and update the fire risk assessment regularly.

### Stakeholders in fire safety, prevention and control

- Employers
- Employees
- Others(government etc)

## Audit Stages

###### Stage 1

- A Walk Thro’
- Name & physical Address
- Work force: males, females, vulnerable gps
- Raw materials, processes and products
- Existence of medical service, medical examinations, first aid and fire
  fighting equipments etc
- Points of exposure to fire hazards

###### Stage 2

- Detailed documentation
- Work Environment measurements
- Medical Examination of workers
