# Assessment of Nutrition Status

Dr Opiyo

## Nutritional status and assessment

**Nutrition status** is the balance between dietary intake and metabolic requirements.

Metabolic requirements: function of age, gender, physiological status, occupation and health status.

Optimal nutritional status: Achieved when sufficient nutrients are consumed to support day-to-day body needs and any increased metabolic demands due to any physiological changes such as growth, pregnancy or illness.

Nutritional assessment: A Process of estimating the Nutritional position/status of an individual or group at a given point in time by using indirect (Proxy) measurements of nutritional adequacy.

## Purposes of carrying out community nutritional assessment

1. To identify individuals or sub-groups in a community who are malnourished or at risk of developing malnutrition (for screening).
2. To Specify the nature and magnitude of nutritional problem (s) (baseline survey)
3. To establish the extent to which an intervention, treatment or program has had the intended effect – impact (for program/project evaluation).
4. To monitor or assess trends and changes over time in the nutrition situation of a country or region (for surveillance).

## Components of Nutritional Assessment

**_Nutritional surveillance:_** Continuous monitoring of the nutrition status of selected population subgroups. It identifies possible causes of malnutrition, and therefore can be used to formulate and initiate intervention measures. Used for decision making by governments.

**_Nutrition Screening:_** Comparison of an individual's measurement with predetermined risk levels or cut off points. Serves to identify individuals requiring nutritional intervention. Can be at individual level or on subpopulation considered to be at risk. Risk factors which would necessitate a more comprehensive nutritional assessment include:

- Weight <80% or >120% of ideal weight
- A history of unintentional weight loss of >4.5 kg
- Serum albumin concentration of <3.5g/dl (for chronic protein depletion)
- A history of illness
- Symptoms or factors associated with nutritional depletion or inadequate
  nutrient intake or absorption.

**_Nutrition Surveys:_** Epidemiological investigation into the nutritional status of a population together with an evaluation of the causative ecological factors: Typically **_prevalence studies, cross sectional in nature_**. Used to collect baseline data to determine population subgroups at risk of malnutrition.
Purpose: Community diagnosis: to identify the principal deficiency diseases in a community in different age groups as well as the probable causes. Data from nutrition surveys are largely concerned with the prevalence of certain conditions. In nutrition surveys, two broad types of information are required: _(ref: Conceptual framework)_: - Information describing outcome (manifestation) - Information explaining causes (factors responsible for the outcome)

## Nutrition status of children

The nutritional status of children does not only directly reflect the socioeconomic status of the family and social wellbeing of the community, but also the efficiency of the health care system, and the influence of the surrounding environment. Children most vulnerable to **_inadequate food intake and diseases,_** the major immediate causes of malnutrition.

> Infants & Young Children: Rapid growth, High nutrient requirements,
> Inadequate diets, A time of continuous stress from bacterial, viral
> and parasitic infections.

## Methods of nutrition assessment

### The ABCD of Nutritional Assessments

- **A**nthropometric Measurements of characteristics of physical dimensions & composition of the human body (**_Weight, Height/Length, Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC), Edema_**) relative to age and sex
- **B**iochemical or Laboratory assessments tests of blood, urine stool, hair for nutrient levels
- **C**linical assessments involving physical observation of clinical signs of
  malnutrition associated with micronutrient deficiencies & PEM.
- **D**ietary assessments of food intakes over a period of time to establish food consumption patterns & nutrient intake adequacy.

## Biochemical/laboratory assessment of nutritional status

Biochemical changes in the body deviate earlier from “normal” than clinical or
anthropometric changes. Changes often result from: _inadequate dietary intake, impaired absorption or increased loss of nutrients_. These lead to:

1. Diminishing nutrient reserves
2. Depletion of nutrient reserves
3. Physiological & metabolic alteration, and eventually to non-specific signs, illnesses, permanent damage (disability) & death.

### Advantages of biochemical methods

1. They are more nutrient specific
2. Much more reliable than other assessment tests
3. Provide early detection of potential nutrient-related problem

### Disadvantages of biochemical methods

1. Are more expensive
2. Requires expensive. (Biochemical tests equipment, material)
3. Requires highly trained manpower
4. Special arrangements needed for transport and storage of biological specimen/samples collected

Urine excretion only shows recent intake & more research still needed on it in population surveys. |

## Dietary assessment methods

Involves examination of food intakes over a period of time. Purposes of dietary assessment:

- Essential for investigating diet health relationships
- Useful in identification of nutrient intake
- Formulating policies to reduce health risks
- Predicting adequacy of the food supply
- Monitoring trends in food use
- Assessing exposure to contaminants and compliance with dietary guidelines.

### Dietary survey methods

Interpretation of nutrient data involves use of food composition tables with reference nutrient values of food.
There are four main dietary survey methods:

1. **_Duplicate analysis:_** _most accurate but expensive method._ All foods & drinks are weighed & measured. Duplicate weighed food samples are taken at the same time for laboratory analysis for nutrient content. Any error here my be mainly due to _sampling & laboratory errors._
2. **_Weighing method:_** All ingredients for cooked food & all other food are weighed. Cooked food are weighed before serving plus all waste food. Nutrient intakes are calculated using food composition tables.
3. **_Recording of food:_** Respondents are required to weigh or measure & record their food intake over 3-7 days. _Is a more accurate method than just a 1 day ( 24 hour recall) method._
4. **_Recall methods:_** (24 hour recall ,food frequencies and diet history method): There are three types of recall methods:

- **_24 hour recall:_** May be by interview or self administered questionnaire; Useful for providing _qualitative & quantitative data_ collection on dietary intake. Respondents are asked to state all foods & amounts eaten in the last 24 hours. These are later converted into weights from which nutrient analysis can be derived. Method is `fairly accurate in estimating group average intakes, but not for individual intake.` **_WHY???_**
- **_Food frequencies:_** Mainly _descriptive qualitative method_. Usually administered in form of _a food checklist_. Respondents are asked about their usual intake of certain food items per day, week or month. Respondents are _not asked to specify exact portion sizes._ Foods are often grouped together based on principal nutrients. Method is good for identifying people who may _need more detailed dietary assessment_ (_is a screening tool in dietary assessment_). Does not require experience in enumeration.
- **_Diet history methods:_** Mainly useful for _determining respondents usual eating patterns e.g. how many times per day/week/month they usually eat certain foods._ The method provides _descriptive information on dietary patterns_ (taboos, food preferences, & factors determining change in food intake). Takes time, needs confidentiality & proper questionnaire development is crucial.

## Clinical Evaluation of Nutritional Status

Examination of _specific changes related to nutrient deficiencies_. These are changes that can be seen or felt in superficial epithelial tissues. Examples
on the skin, eyes and hair, in organs near the surface of the body e.g. parotid and thyroid glands. Method is _best for advanced stages of nutritional deprivation_ as **_clinical signs are late manifestations of malnutrition_** when overt disease is present. Relatively inexpensive method and with careful training and continuing supervision, junior personnel can be taught to recognize certain crucial clinical signs.

### Clinical features of severe acute malnutrition (SAM)

1. Marasmus:

> Extremely emaciated, Fat and muscle tissue grossly reduced, Thin,
> flaccid skin, hanging in loose folds; ‘old man’s appearance’, May have
> good appetite, Normal hair, Frequent infections with minimal signs,
> Frequent association with dehydration, Alert and irritable

2. Kwashiorkor:

> Bilateral pitting edema on lower legs and feet, can become more
> generalized (hands and arms, ‘moon face’), Reduced fat muscle
> tissue which may be masked by edema, Darkening or reddish
> pigmentation, cracked & peeling; patchy & fragile, prone to infection,
> No appetite, Hair changes color (yellow/reddish) becomes sparse, dry &
> brittle, pulls out easily leaving bald patches, Frequent infections,
> Frequent association with dehydration which may be masked by edema,
> Generally apathetic, lethargic & miserable when left alone. Irritable
> when handled

Clinical evaluation of nutritional status is ineffective for micronutrient deficiencies.
