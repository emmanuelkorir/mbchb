# Review of Malnutrition

Dr Opiyo

## Malnutrition

Malnutrition refers to deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person’s nutrient intake. That imbalance between dietary intake and requirements leads to impairment of health.

It is related to:

- poor quality diets
- inadequate nutrient intake
- malabsorption of nutrients
- poor utilization of nutrients due to infections

### Forms of Malnutrition

Three broad categories of malnutrition conditions:

- Undernutrition: Acute malnutrition/wasting (low weight-for- height), Chronic
  malnutrition/Stunting (low height-for-age) and underweight (low weight-for-age)
- Micronutrient-related malnutrition, which includes micronutrient deficiencies
  or micronutrient excess
- Over nutrition: overweight, obesity and diet-related non- communicable
  diseases (heart disease, stroke, diabetes, some cancers)

## Acute Malnutrition(Wasting)

It reflects a deficit of soft tissues. Observed as thinness/muscle wasting/ loss of muscle mass/atrophy: inability to gain expected weight for a given height. **Expressed as: low weight-for-a given height.** Is **an indicator** of Current Malnutrition.

Caused by:

- Current food shortages
- Current Poor feeding practices
- Current disease conditions.

Depending on duration & severity, wasting can either be in form of **severe acute malnutrition (SAM)** or **moderate acute malnutrition (MAM).**

### Marasmus

> Severe weight loss and wasting
> Ribs prominent
> Limbs emaciated
> Muscle wasting

May have good appetite, with correct treatment good prognosis.

### Kwashiorkor

> Bilateral edema & fluid accumulation
> Loss of appetite
> Brittle thinning hair
> Hair color change
> Apathetic and irritable
> Face may seem swollen
> High risk of death

## Chronic Malnutrition

Recurrent & long-term food shortages & recurrent episodes of illnesses over extended period can lead to chronic malnutrition and result in stunting, which is defined as _failure to grow to the expected height for a given age._

Stunting reflects **a deficit in skeletal development**; an indication of `poor environmental conditions` or `long- term restriction of a child's growth potential`

Stunting is observed as _short stature_ due to failure to grow to the expected height for a given age. Stunting is expressed as **low Height-for-age.** An anthropometric indicator for
_Chronic Malnutrition_

Caused by:

- Poor quality diets over a long period (recurrent) leading to long term reduction in dietary intake
- Repeated episodes of illnesses
- Also associated with poverty which contributes to poor dietary intake & access to health care over a long period of time

### Effects of stunting:

1. Short term
   - Impaired brain development
   - Lower IQ
   - Weakened immune system
2. Long term
   - Lost productivity & healthcare costs
   - Smaller stature
   - Premature death
   - Greater risk of diabetes & cancer

## Micronutrient deficiencies

Micronutrient deficiencies may occur among both under- nourished and over-nourished people. Micronutrient deficiencies may also manifest alongside other malnutrition conditions. Micronutrient deficiencies of public health significance are:

1. Vitamin A
2. Iron
3. Iodine
4. Folic acid
5. Zinc

Causes of Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD). Inadequate intake of vitamin A can be attributed to:

> a) Seasonality
> b) Early cessation of breastfeeding
> c) Failure to consume Vitamin A rich foods.
> d) Low fat quantities in the diet (Fat increases the absorption of beta carotene from dark green leafy vegetables).
> e) High prevalence of intestinal parasites can also impairer absorption of Vitamin A
> f) Protein deficiency: Affects absorption from intestine, release from the liver & transport in the blood of Vitamin A, thus leading to a secondary deficiency

**IRON DEFICIENCY:** Occurs when amount of iron absorbed in the body is not adequate to meet its requirements , and if prolonged, results in iron deficiency anaemia. Caused by consumption of diets low in iron, loss of blood e.g during childbirth & worm infestation
(hookworms), and failure of iron absorption from the diet.

**IODINE DEFICIENCY DISORDERS (IDD):** Effects of IDD are `goiter (enlarged thyroid gland)` and `cretinism (severe mental retardation)`. Effects of IDD start before birth - 12 weeks after conception and include: _still-births, increased infant & child deaths, developmental abnormalities, & effects on brain development_. Low content of iodine in soil, hence low intake.

**Zinc Deficiency Disorders:** Zinc deficiency is characterized by: _growth retardation, loss of appetite, impaired immune function._
Severe zinc deficiency may cause: _hair loss, diarrhea, Infertility esp. in males, eye & skin lesions; weight loss, poor wound healing, taste abnormalities_

### Clinical micronutrient deficiency

The “tip of the iceberg”: Iron - Anaemia; Vitamin A – Nght-blindness; Iodine – goiter; Vitamin C– Scurvy; Zinc –dermatitis; growth retardation; Vitamin B1 – Beri-beri; Vitamin D- rickets

The “iceberg”:

Subclinical micronutrient deficiency: Iron - reduced IQ; affects 1.5 billion people

Globally, vitamin A – increased child mortality; affects over 250 million children

Iodine - Mental retardation, Zinc- growth impairment; increased child mortality – over 800,000 child deaths per year

Iron deficiency - affects 1.5 billion people worldwide

Vitamin A deficiency - 250 million pre-school children

Zinc deficiency - contributes to 800,000 child deaths per year

Folate deficiency - severe birth defects in 150,000 newborns each year

Iodine deficiency - affects 18 million newborns each year

Over-nutrition: Over-nutrition in form of Obesity is also becoming increasingly common among children & women in developing countries, including Kenya. Obesity is an excess of body fat, usually 20% overweight for age/sex/height. Several interrelated determinants affect food intake, utilization of the food by the body due to illness or both.

## Determinants of Malnutrition in Children

Pay specific attention to:

i. Malnutrition and inadequate nutrient intake

ii. Malnutrition and infection - use different infections including COVID-19 to discuss the relationship between the two

iii. Underlying causes of malnutrition at the household level (Food insecurity, Inadequate maternal care & child care practices & Inadequate healthcare and unhealthy environment)

Malnutrition and infection

Children who are malnourished and sick are more likely to die than the well nourished children. The same is likely to occur with such children who get the COVID-19 infection. Why?

### Causes of under-nutrition

The interplay between inadequate dietary intake and Infection at the individual level tends to create a vicious circle. A malnourished child whose resistance to infection is compromised, falls ill and malnourishment worsens. One condition feeds off the other.

#### Underlying determinants of Under-nutrition

Mainly concern unmet basic needs of children & women and include 3 main clusters at household
level:

- Inadequate Household Food Security
- Inadequate care for women and children
- Inadequate health, health services and unhealthy environment, including poor water & sanitation.

##### Household Food Security

An understanding of food access, availability & utilization at household level is important to understand nutrition situation.
Consider the following factors:

- Access to food - market prices, terms of trade, household income, perception of food
  insecurity, dietary diversity
- Availability of food – production (agricultural and livestock), availability of local markets,
  rainfall patterns
- Utilization of food – intra household distribution, meal frequency, food preference, gender
  issues
- Coping strategies – strategies households undertake to meet their food needs
- Availability: is achieved if people have adequate food at their disposal.
- Access is ensured when all households and all individuals within those households have
  sufficient resources to obtain appropriate foods (through production, purchase or donation)
  for a nutritious diet.
- Utilization: the ability of the human body to ingest and metabolize the food
- Stability affects availability, access and utilization of food

### CARING PRACTICES

They help translate available food & health resource into adequate food intake & prevention of
diseases. For the child’s well-being.

- Feeding practices – Breastfeeding & complementary feeding
- Hygiene & health seeking practices (+immunization & early detection & treatment of infections)
- Emotional support & cognitive stimulation for children & women
- Care & support for women (adolescent girls, pregnant & lactating mothers)

### Care Practices indicators

- Infant feeding practices – breastfeeding practices, initiation, exclusive duration, introduction
  of other liquids and solids, use of bottles, reason for stopping
- Complementary feeding – age-complementary foods introduced, types and preparation
  methods
- Young child feeding – foods fed to young children, number of meals per day, snacks, feeding
  methods, e.g., sharing plates
- Home health practices – treatment of simple childhood illness, traditional treatments
- Hygiene practices – hand washing practices, disposal of child feces
- Food preparation and storage – food preparation, storage, cooking

### Public Health & Environment Factors

- Access to basic health services (should reduce severity & duration of infections) as
  determined by distance & cost of health services
- Access to potable water & sanitation
- Presence of mosquito (malaria) breeding sites
- prevalence of the main childhood illnesses (malaria, diarrhea, acute respiratory infection, measles & in general population, Immunization & de-worming status of other community members

### Basic Causes of Malnutrition

Most underlying causes are the result of basic (or structural) causes related to unequal distribution of resources in a society, historical background and other external factors (Political, Legal and Cultural Factors). Basic causes are the real reasons behind the underlying causes of malnutrition.
