## Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative

Goal: enable all women to breastfeed exclusively for 6 months of age.

- No pre-lacteal feeds
- BF on demand.
- Express breast milk - teach mothers
- Maternal nutrition
- Family and community support

**Specific Objectives**
To transform hospitals and maternity facilities into maternity facilities into baby friendly institutions by:

- implementing the 10 steps to successful breastfeeding according to global BFHI assessment criteria.
- End free and low cost distribution of breastmilk substitutes

###### Global criteria- 10 steps 1 & 2

Have a written breastfeeding policy that is routinely communicated to all health care staff.

Train all health care staff in skills necessary to implement the policy - HW in contact with babies - 80%. Support to non-BF mothers.

###### Step 3

Inform all pregnant women about the benefits and management of breastfeeding.

Content?? Importance of BF, early initiation, BF on demand, attachment and positioning, EBF and continued BF for 2 years and beyond.

Target: 70% 3rd trimester 2 ANC visits counselled and can explain what was discussed.

##### Step 4 & 5

Help mothers initiate breastfeeding within half hour of birth.

Show mothers how to breastfeed and how to maintain lactation even if separated from their babies - includes preparation of feeds for replacement feeding.

###### Step 6

Give newborn infants no food or drink other that BM unless medically indicated.

No BM substitutes/materials distributed to mothers.

Target: 75% babies delivered EBF. 80% choosing not to BF counselled on IF options and assisted to make choice.

###### Step 7

Practice rooming mothers and babies 24 hours together.

Target: 80% mothers in post-natal wards rooming in or with justifiable reasons for not rooming in.

###### Step 8

Encourage breastfeeding on demand.

Target: 80% shown how to recognise when babies cry

###### Step 9

Give no artificial teats or pacifiers.

Target: 80% mothers on postpartum wards not using bottles/pacifiers

###### Step 10

Foster establishment of breastfeeding support groups and refer mothers to them upon discharge.

Target:

- Facility fosters establishment of mother support groups
- Printed information given to mothers upon discharge

###### Revitalisation of BFHI - Strategies

Triple A approach: Assess, analyse, act.

How?

- Assess status - self-assessment (Certificate of commitment)
- Analyse faps - steps not implemented
- Action - Plan to address gaps and targets

**BFHI not an end in itself!**

- Proportion of women BF exclusively from birth to discharge serves as a proxy indicator on extent to which BF is supported promoted and protected in a facility.
- Annual targets should show 75% of women delivering in a facility BFed exclusively from birth to discharge.

**BFHI designation process**

- External hospital assessment - Standard tool/Protocols
- Certification
- On-going reassessment of status
