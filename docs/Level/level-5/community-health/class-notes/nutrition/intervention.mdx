# Nutrition interventions

## Consequences of under-nutrition in children;

Malnutrition has negative consequences on health, physical and cognitive growth, intellectual performance and earning potential, thereby constraining social & economic development of communities and countries; Inhibits the body’s immune system from fighting disease, inhibits cognitive, social-emotional and motor development. There are irreversible consequences of chronic malnutrition early in life; Malnutrition during childhood also results in nutrition related non-communicable diseases later in life.

**Goal of Nutrition interventions**

Improve nutrition, to save lives, increase economic productivity and advance development by;

- Preventing & reducing all forms of malnutrition among women of reproductive age & children under 5 years with a focus on the first 1000 days window (Pregnancy to a child’s second birthday);
- Nutritional intervention therefore refers to purposefully planned corrective measures undertaken to rectify the occurrence of overall malnutrition or specific nutrient deficiency or excess.

## Nutrition interventions

Classification of nutrition interventions varies a lot with time, nutrition problems and research evidence;

**The Lancet Set of interventions:**

- Direct/Nutrition-specific Interventions
- Indirect/Nutrition-sensitive Interventions

**WHO e-Library of Evidence for Nutrition Actions (eLENA)** by type and categories

**Window of Opportunity for nutrition interventions**

Science has shown that the first 1000 days (Pregnancy & a child’s second birthday) are the most critical to ensure physical and cognitive development. Hence this is the period that needs targeting with interventions to prevent malnutrition

Focus-Key interventions in **“1000 days window of opportunity”**

- Good maternal nutrition
- Optimal breastfeeding (Immediate & Exclusive breastfeeding)
- Appropriate complementary feeding (Dietary diversity)
- Appropriate hygiene practices

**Strategies:**

1. **Multi-sectoral approach** that addresses direct and underlying causes of malnutrition.
2. **Implementation of high impact interventions** in health, nutrition, agriculture, education, water & sanitation
3. **Scale up** effective, integrated nutrition specific (to address immediate causes of undernutrition) and nutrition sensitive interventions (to address underlying & basic causes)

### Nutrition-Specific Interventions

#### Kenya's High Impact Nutrition Interventions (HINI)

A package of 13 cost-effective (High Impact) nutrition interventions (HINI) are being promoted in the “1,000 Days window of opportunity “ to address immediate causes of undernutrition ie inadequate dietary intake & diseases (malaria, diarrhea, intestinal parasites).

1. Promote exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months. (Evidence shows that **13% deaths are prevented**)
2. Promote optional complementary feeding for infants after 6 months of age (Evidence: **6% deaths prevented**)
3. Periodic vitamin A supplementation 2 doses/yr for children 6 - 59 months has shown 2% deaths prevented. The recommended doses are 100 000 international units (IU) for children aged between 6 and 11 months, and 200 000 IU for children aged between 12 and 59 months.
4. Zinc supplementation for diarrhea management. **5% deaths prevented.**
5. Multiple micronutrient powders for children < 5 yrs to improve micronutrient intake.
6. Iron-folic acid supplementation for pregnant women to prevent and treat anemia (**20% reduction maternal mortality**).
7. De-worming drugs for children (reduce nutrient loss and Prevent anaemia)
8. Promote of improved hygiene practices including hand washing to prevent diarrhea disease
9. Salt iodization. 13% increase in intelligence quotient
10. Iron fortification of staple foods. 17% increase in adult work productivity
11. Prevention or treatment for moderate under-nutrition
12. Treatment of severe under-nutrition (SAM) with ready to use therapeutic foods (RUTF)

**Scale-up Requires**

- Leadership
- Funding
- Partnerships & coordination
- Advocacy
- Monitoring & evaluation
- Long term commitment

## Nutrition-Sensitive Strategies

- Family planning - health spacing of pregnancies
- Water, sanitation & hygiene
- Nutrition sensitive agriculture
- Food safety & processing
- Early childhood care and development
- Girls and women's education and empowerement
- Economic strengthening, livelihoods and social protection
- Explicitly designed to address direct & underlying determinants of undernutrition
- Food intake
- Disease/Infections
- Household food security
- Infectious disease control (public health & environmnet factors)
- Caring practices

## Overview of Nutrition Interventions

- Micronutrient supplementation
- Food supplementation
- Food fortification
- School feeding
- Growth Monitoring
- Nutrition surveillance
- Disease control
- Maternal & child care
- Kitchen gardens & small animal husbandry
- Food aid & food for work
