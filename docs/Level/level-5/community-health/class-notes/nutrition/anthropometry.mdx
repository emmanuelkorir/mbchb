# Assessment of Community Nutrition Status Using Anthropometry

## Definition

**Nutritional Anthropometry:** measurements of characteristics of physical dimensions & gross composition of the human
body (Weight, Height/Length, Mid- Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC), waist circumference, skin-fold thickness, head circumference , Edema) relative/in relations to age & sex. Justification: nutrition influences a child’s physical development

## Advantages of Anthropometry Methods

- Is convenient, non-invasive and usually culturally acceptable
- Is sensitive to changes in nutritional status
- Uses relatively reliable & inexpensive equipment
- Requires only basic training to perform measurements - much less than for clinical
  examinationCan provide accurate quantitative data
- Potentially measures current & past malnutrition (PEM under-nutrition in children &
  adults including pregnant women);
- Assessment of obesity and overweight in all age-groups
  Disadvantages

## Taking Anthropometry measures

Preparing a child for anthropometric measurements: Observe the child and note any clinical signs of marasmus and kwashiorkor(done with **minimal clothing** on).

Rapid Nutritional Anthropometry assessment methods:

- Mid- upper arm circumference
- Waist circumference in adult

1. **Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC)**

Measures the circumference of the upper arm to assess current nutritional status and child growth. MUAC-for-age when plotted on a child’s growth curve, reflects body fat relative to the chronological age of the child.

- Useful for **children 6 months - 59 months**; -both under-nutrition & obesity
- Is an _alternative nutritional status indicator_ for use where it is difficult to take weight & height measurements for assessing wasting.
- Also useful as a _proxy for pregnancy weight gain_, hence an _indicator of low birth-weight babies._

### Demonstration on MUAC

Prepare the child and ensuring the arm to measure is bare. Feel the acromion process (tip of shoulder) to get mid point of arm;When measuring ensure MUAC tape is straight (no bends/kinks), measure on left hand/less active arm, don’t estimate mid arm measure (measure it with arm at 90 degrees), relax child’s arm to take MUAC, read and record accurately (Normal: green, at risk and moderate: yellow and red: severe)

</div>

In case of severe malnutrition, MUAC is used as a **predictor of mortality** – those with low MUAC and are severely malnourished are more likely to die. Useful as a _quick screening tool for admitting malnourished children in nutrition feeding program._

MUAC is an appropriate indicator for _assessment of acute adult under-nutrition & over-nutrition_. Although MUAC cut-off points for both children and adults vary by country the following are suggested:

2. **Weight measurement**
   Changes in weight in young children are an indicator of the general health & well being of the entire population.

Weighing scales used:

- **Salter scale** measuring up to 25 kg with a special bag – For children less than 6 years (up-to 59 months) old.
- **Bathroom or digital scale** measuring up to 100 kg. For children > 6 years & adults or adult holding
  child, then subtract adult’s weight to get child’s weight.

Where both mother and child are weighed, Children should be weighed **without** clothes on. Adults
should only have minimum underclothes on.

Taking weight measurement:

- Adjust the pointer of the salter scale to zero level.
- Take off the child’s heavy clothes and shoes.
- Hold the child’s legs through the leg holes Hold the child’s feet (arrow 2).
- Hang the child on the Salter Scale (arrow 3).
- Read the scale at eye level to the nearest 0.1 kg (arrow 5).
- Remove the child slowly and safely.

3. **Height**
   Height/length of children changes over time & is dependent on their nutrient intake & utilization.

- For **infants & children < 2 years old**, the **supine length** (Lying down on back of the body: **crown-heel length**) should be take.
- For older children and adults, take the height/stature; the standing distance from crown of the head to the bottom of the feet (heel).

**Taking a child's length:**

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/JlEq3jd.png" alt="length-board" />
</div>

- For **children less than 87 cm** (**under 2 years old**), a wooden measuring board (also called **sliding board**)is used for measuring the length of children. Child is placed lying down flat along middle of board. Both assistant and measurer to be on their knees; The assistant holds the sides of the child's head, positions the head until it firmly touches the fixed headboard with hair compressed. The measurer places her hands on the child's legs, gently stretches the child and then keeps one hand on the thighs to prevent flexion.

</div>

While positioning the child's legs, the **sliding foot-plate** is pushed firmly against the bottom of the child's feet. The child’s foot should be flat against the foot-piece. Read the length from the tape attached to the board. Record the measurement on the questionnaire. The length is read and recorded to the nearest 0.1cm.

- For **children taller than 87 cm** the same wooden measuring board is fixed upright on level ground. The child stands, upright against the middle of the measuring board. Child's head, shoulders, buttocks, knees, heels held flat against the board by assistant. Child should look straight ahead (**arrow 8**).Child’s hands should be by their side (**arrow**). The measurer’s left hand should be on child’s chin (**arrow 9**). The child’s shoulders should be levelled (**arrow 10**). Head piece should be placed firmly on child’s head (**arrow 15**). Measurer positions head and cursor and height is read to nearest 0.1 cm and recorded immediately.

### Assessment of overweight & obesity in adults

1. **Waist circumference**
   Abdominal fat (around the waist): predictor of risk for obesity- related diseases, and is more likely to contribute to health problems than the fat in the hips and thighs.WC can be used to measure abdominal fat; WC: a better estimate of visceral fat, the dangerous internal fat on internal organs.

Obesity is defined using **WC in Men as WC of more than 102 cm (40 inches)** and **in Women as WC of more than 88 cm (35 inches)**; WC is _a more accurate predictor of cardiovascular risk, type 2 diabetes in women and metabolic syndrome._

**Measuring Waist Circumference**
Place the tape measure directly on your skin, or over no more than 1 layer of light clothing. It should be at halfway between your lowest rib and the top of your hipbone (about in line with your belly button). Breathe out normally and measure. Ensure the tape is snug, but does not compress the skin, and is parallel to the floor.

2. **Body Mass Index (BMI)**
   BMI is an index used to _estimate ones body fat_. It indicates individual’s health risks by comparing height and weight. BMI is used to _assess overweight or risk of overweight and thinness in older children_, adolescents and adults. Total body fat is related to the risk of disease and death.
   `BMI = Weight (Kg)/Height (m)2`

BMI Categories:

- **Underweight**: **Less than 18.5**
- **Normal (Healthy) Weight**: **18.5-24.9**
- **Moderately Overweight**: **25-29.9**
- **Severe overweight (Obesity)**: **30 or more**

:::warning NOTE
In Children, use BMI-for-Age to assess obesity. (Weigh for height, changes with age)
:::

#### Limitations of BMI

1. BMI only estimates body fat
2. Not applicable to pregnant women and athletes whose increase in weight is not due to
   body fat
3. Highly trained athletes and body builders have high BMI due to of increased muscularity, not increased body fatness
4. People with a high % of muscle mass may appear overweight using BMI because muscle weighs more than fat.
5. Pregnant women: variations in body weight is due to health & nutrition status of mother and growing fetus. BMI therefore not suitable. _Use MUAC instead_
6. BMI may underestimate body fat in older persons and others who have been chronically ill and lost muscle mass
