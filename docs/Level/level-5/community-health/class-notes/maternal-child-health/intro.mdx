# Introduction to MCH

Dr Peter Njoroge

## Analytical framework for determining maternal and child mortality and morbidity

### Maternal

- Underlying: Women status in family and community, family status in the
  community, communityâ€™s status, global perspective, wealth distribution
- Intermediate: maternal age, health status of the woman, reproductive status of
  woman, access to health services, health care behavior, unpredicted factors
- Outcomes: mortality, disability, pregnancy complications

### Child

- Proximate: cycle between infections (malaria, measles, pneumonia, diarrhea,
  acute ART) and malnutrition
- Intermediate: gestation at birth, birth weight, infections in mum during
  pregnancy eg HIV and syphilis, nutrition (newborn infant feeding practices),
  susceptibility (immunization status of child), health care (access, health care
  seeking behaviors), exposure (sanitization issues)
- Distant: household characteristics (education status of the mother),
  community factors (availability of health care services, access, wealth status
  of community), national/regional context eg programmes like UNICEF
- Outcome: under 5 mortality, morbidity

## Alma Atta

Elements of Alma-Atta (international conference on PHC, 1978) state element related to
MCH and FP

PHC includes at least: education concerning prevailing health problems and the
methods of preventing and controlling them; promotion of food supply and proper
nutrition; an adequate supply of safe water and basic sanitation; maternal and child
health care, including family planning; immunization against the major infectious
diseases; prevention and control of locally endemic diseases; appropriate treatment of
common diseases and injuries; and provision of essential drugs

## MDG

UN in 2000 at New York, came up with MDG (8 elements) to be achieved by 2015 (state
goals related to MCH and the achievements by 2015)

- MDG 4: Reduce child mortality: Reduce by two thirds the mortality of children under
  five.

The Kenya Demographic Health Survey (KDHS) 2014 shows that compared to
the 2003, the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) improved to 39 from 77 per 1000 live
births and the Under Five Mortality Rate improving to 52 from 115 per 1000 live
births. Neonatal mortality rate 39 per 1000 compared to?

- MDG 5: Improve maternal health: Reduce maternal mortality by three quarters.
  Achieve universal access to reproductive health.

The KDHS 2014, shows 362 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births compared to
414/100,000 in 2003, 590/100,000 in 1998.

The contraceptive prevalence rate for modern methods among married women
increased from 32% to 39% between 2003 and 2008 while at the same time, the
use of traditional methods decreased from 8 to 6% of married women.

The unmet need for family planning, which is still considered high, has remained
at 24 percent since 1998.

## SDG

SDG in Rio, achieved by 2030, 17 global goals (state goals related to MCH)

</div>

By 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live
births.

By 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services,
including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of
reproductive health into national strategies and programmes.

By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with
all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live
births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births.
