# UN Process Indicators for Monitoring Obstetric Care

Dr Njoroge

## Significance of Maternal Mortality

Widely acknowledged as a general indicator of the:

- Overall health of a population;
- Status of women in society;
- Functioning of the health system;
- A useful tool for advocacy in health matters

## Issues with MMR data

- Reluctance to report abortion-related deaths
- Problems of memory recall
- Lack of medical attribution
- Weak vital registration systems
- Expensive to obtain
- Comparative rarity on a population basis

## Process Indicators

Are monitoring tools that can provide information about where interventions to
reduce maternal mortality are needed.

Focus specifically on monitoring whether women who develop serious obstetric
complications receive the services they need.

Justified as MMRs are **_difficult to obtain; often inaccurate because of under-reporting and misclassification_**; yet are not actionable.

The indicators have a background in the Standards or Signal Functions for emergency
obstetric care namely the:

- Basic Emergency Obstetric Care (BEmOC), provided in
  health centers and small maternity homes
- Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric Care (CEmOC/ CEmONC), typically delivered in district/sub-county hospitals and higher levels

## BEmOC / BEmONC

i. Parenteral Administration of antibiotics

ii. Parenteral Administration of oxytocin

iii. Parenteral Administration of anticonvulsants

iv. Manual removal of the retained placenta

v. Removal of retained products following miscarriage or abortion by Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA)

vi. Assisted vaginal delivery with forceps or vacuum extractor

vii. Newborn resuscitation with bag and mask

## CEmOC / CEmONC

i. All basic functions above, plus capabilities for

ii. Safe blood transfusion

iii. Caesarean section (trained staff, a functional operating theatre and ability to administer anesthesia)

| Indicator                | Definition | Minimum Level |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ------------- |
| 1. Availability of Basic |

Emergency Obstetric
Care (BEmOC)
|Number of health facilities
providing BEmOC functions
per unit of population.
|4 BEmOC facilities for every
500,000 population|
|2. Availability of
Comprehensive
Emergency Obstetric
Care (CEmOC)
|Number of health facilities
providing CEmOC functions
per unit of population.
|1 CEmOC facility for every
500,000 population|
|3. Institutional Deliveries| Proportion of all deliveries
taking place in health facilities|15% of all births taking place
in health facilities.|
|4. Met Need for
Emergency Obstetric
Care (EOC)|Proportion of women with an
emergency obstetric
complication treated in EOC
facilities
|100% (all) women with
emergency obstetric
complications
|
|5. Caesarian Section Rate| Proportion of Caesarian
Sections to all births
|No less than 5% and no more
than 15%|
|6. Case Fatality Rate in
Facilities|
Proportion of women with an
emergency obstetric
complication admitted to a
facility who die|
CFR should be less than 1%|

## Relevance of the Six Process Indicators

**Indicators 1 and 2** deal with **coverage**, answering the question: do enough obstetric services
exist to serve the population?

**Indicator 3** deals with **utilization**, answering the question: are the services being used by
pregnant women?

**Indicators 4 and 5** also deal with **utilization**, but focuses on the question of complications: are
the services being used by women who really need them, i.e. women experiencing obstetric
complications?

**Indicator 6** tells us something about the **quality of service**, by answering the question:
can the facilities save a womanâ€™s life?
