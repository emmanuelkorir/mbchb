# Referrals & MCH

In the policy documents: The right to the highest attainable standard of health guaranteed in the
constitution of Kenya which includes the rights to reproductive health care, can be possible only
through an effective health referral system in a hierarchical health system (levels of care and national
versus county governments)

## Key strategies for reducing maternal deaths and suffering

Experience from successful maternal health programs suggest three key strategies:

- Simply meeting the unmet need for the contraceptive services
- Having skilled attendants and functioning referral system available to all women in
  labor
- Timely emergency obstretic care for women who develop complications

In the goals of MCH program:

The sixth goal: to identify high risk cases and refer: identify high risk
cases (clinical, nutritional, obstretic, socia) and arrange for frequent follow up or referral

In the Kenya essential package for health KEPH: The referral strategy provides guidance on the
linkage of services and continuity of care across the different levels in KEPH in line with the
comprehensive service delivery approach. A good functioning referral system ensures clients health
needs are managed comprehensively through use of health sector resources beyond those available
where they access care

4 tiers based on the scope and complexity of services offered:

- The **first tier** comprise comprises community units that are collection of households staffed by
  volunteer community health workers. Activities at the community unit level focused mainly
  on promoting health through health education, treatment of minor ailments and identification
  of cases for referral to health facilities
- **Tier 2 (dispensaries and health centers);** offer primary healthcare services. These two levels
  of care form the interface between the community and the higher level facilities. These
  facilities offer basic outpatient care, minor surgical services, basic lab services, maternity care
  and limited inpatient facilities. They also coordinate the community units under the
  jurisdiction. Referrals in the presidential and linda mama package
- **Tier 3** made up of KEPH level 4 and 5 the secondary referral facilities formed the **county
  referral facilities**. They offer a broad spectrum of curative services and some are also health
  training centers
- **Tier 4 (level 6)** constitutes the tertiary referral facility that offers specialized care and
  specialized training to health workers. The national government manages these facilities but
  there are semi autonomous organizations

#### In the service delivery approach

The categorization of service delivery into six levels of care or four tier based on the scope and
complexity of services offered means that a clientâ€™s access to health service delivery may not be able
to adequately manage the clients health needs. The referral system is what facilitates continuity of
care across the different levels of care

### Framework for health referral services

The full scope of referral services expected of the health services include: **movement of clients, expertise movement, specimen movement and client parameter movements**.Client and service or
expertise movement involve the actual movement of individuals within the health system that
eventually leads to management of clients legitimate health needs

1. **Client movement;** The actual clients seeking an appropriate level of care at which their health
   needs are best addressed. This is the most recognized form of referral service expected of the
   health system and is what most persons equate to referral system

2. **Expertise movement;** There are some instances when it may be more efficient for movement
   of given expertise or services particularly for non emergency management of clients to be
   drawn down either on a regular basis or on and ad hoc basis if feasible at a lower level of care
   the system of rotation and facilitation of expertise movement would then be strengthened. In.
   Some other instances it may not be cost effective for both the client and the health system to
   move individuals in this case additional expertise is sought for only a part of the management
   of the client through special referrals or through client parameter referrals

3. **Specimen movement;** Movement of just a specimen usually for investigative purposes is one
   form of referral considered. Biopsies or samples for notifiable conditions would best be
   managed through this referral approach. It avoids having to actually move the client within
   the health services

4. **Client parameter movement;** This type of referral is helpful in avoiding difficult or disruptive
   movement of clients when a significant part of management process can be provided at the
   level the client has presented. Client information can be sent for supportive diagnosis or
   management guidance to appropriate level of system through innovative ICT in health
   services particularly in the context of e health scale up
