# Sampling Distribution of 2 Means

Dr Mweu

## Two Means & Proportions

Comparing two means: The objective here is to compare the mean value in two population, or
in two sub-populations by;

- Calculating a confidence interval for the difference between 2 sample means which
  allows for sampling error in estimating the difference between the true means
- Testing the hypothesis that the true means in the 2 populations are equal

The underlying assumptions in these calculations are:

- Variable of interest is normally distributed
- Observations are independent i.e. random samples are chosen independently from the
  2 pops of interest and there’s no connection, for example, between 1st observation in
  one sample and the 1st observation in the other sample (sample of children in Nairobi
  Vs Mombasa; and not related)

- In small sample size, we use t distribution; An assumption is that 𝜎1 and 𝜎2 are equal to a
  common value (common variance).

## Sampling distribution of the difference between 2 means:

Random samples of size n1 and n2 are taken from 2 pops of interest. The means and SDs of a
quantitative variable x in the 2 pops and samples are:

If random samples of a given size of the variable x (eg weigh) were taken repeatedly in each
of population 1 & population 2 and each time we measured (𝑥1 - 𝑥2 ) we would
find that:

- The values of 𝑥1 , 𝑠1, 𝑥2 , 𝑠2 would vary from sample to sample
- The values of (𝑥1 - 𝑥2 ) would be distributed symmetrically (normal
  distribution) above and below the true population value (𝜇1 -𝜇2)
- Values near (𝜇1 -𝜇2) would occur more frequently than values far from (𝜇1 -
  𝜇2)

## Confidence interval for difference between 2 means

Assuming a large sample size (n≥ 20) the 95% CI for the difference between
2 means is given by:

</div>

:::info NOTE
If there’s no real difference between the 2 means the CI around the difference should
include zero (statistically the same)
:::

Example: In a cohort study in northeast Brazil, the mental and psychomotor development of
low birth weight (1500-2499g) infants born at ≥37 weeks gestation (at term), were compared
to those of a control sample of infants born with appropriate birth weight (3000-3499g).
Results for mental development 12 months of age in samples of low and appropriate birth
weight infants were as follows:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/eF9P9nH.jpg" alt="example" />
</div>

What can be said about the mental development scores of children in these 2 groups (compare
them)?
So the 95% CI for the difference (𝜇1 -𝜇2) is given by:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/RZltaDI.png" alt="example" />
</div>

(115.1 – 108.1) ∓ 1.96√(9.442/84 + 11.52/84) or 7.0 ∓ 1.96\*1.623
Which is: **3.82 to 10.18** (doesn’t include 0; a difference exist between mental development in
the 2 groups)

So we are 95% confident that the true population mean difference in mental development scores of ABW and LBW lies between **3.82 and 10.18**

## Significance test for comparison of 2 means

To test the hypothesis about the difference (𝜇1 -𝜇2) between 2 pop means, we write:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>

</div>

After calculating the Z, the P-value may be read from tables of the normal distribution.

:::info NOTE
After calculating the Z, if the value is less than critical value is 1.96(z score at 95%) accept the null hypothesis. If the Z value is bigger than the crictical, reject the null hypothesis.
:::

**Example:** In a cohort study in northeast Brazil, the mental and psychomotor development of
low birth weight (1500-2499g) infants born at ≥37 weeks gestation (at term), were compared
to those of a control sample of infants born with appropriate birth weight (3000-3499g).
Results for mental development 12 months of age in samples of low and appropriate birth
weight infants were as follows:

(115.1 – 108.1)/√(9.442/84 + 11.52/84) or 7.0/1.623 = 4.31
From the Z tables, read off 4.31; we find that P value is (reading off at 3.2 (99%); 0.0005 x 2)
thus **_p value is < 0.001_**. ()

In other words, **_there’s strong evidence for a real difference between the 2 population means (reject null hypothesis, accept alternative hypothesis)_**

:::note tip
From the example, 4.31 is not in the z-score table, as a rule you make use of 3.29 which is 0.0005 that covers 99.9% of the curve, 0.0005 x 2 gives P value < 0.001
:::

NB: Note the close relationship between the significance test and the confidence interval. The
test will give a P-value less than 0.05 if the 95% CI excludes the hypothesized value (0) and
vice versa. In the example, the 95% CI (3.82 to 10.2) excludes zero, and the P-value is less
than 0.05.

## T - test

- If sample sizes are small (n < 20), and distribution of the individual values are approx. normal,
  a t distribution is used
- An additional assumption is that 𝜎<sub>1</sub> and 𝜎<sub>2</sub> are **_equal_** to a common value (**_common variance_**);
  get an average of the two since could be numerically different but statistically same: Sp<sup>2</sup>. So,

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/oS7PRd2.png" alt="t-test" />
</div>

However, if variances are different (unequal variances) then: First, test for equality of
variances using an 𝐹 test:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/QUe1OEL.png" alt="f-test" />
</div>

If the 𝐹 test-statistic calculated above is significant then perform:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/i3Y7OIh.png" alt="welch t-test" />
</div>

NB: It is common to see t-tests used where sample sizes are large and adequate for use of z
test.

:::tip
If the calculated t value is > the critical value, reject the null hypothesis. If the calculcated t value is < the critical value, accept the null hypothesis.
