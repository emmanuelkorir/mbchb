# Probability Distributions

Dr Mweu

## Definitions

- **Probability:** is the possibility that an event will occur
- **Experiment/trial:** any process of observation/measurement e.g. checking if switch is turned off or counting no. of wounds on a patient
- **Outcomes:** the results of the experiment e.g. counts for number of wound, yes/no answers etc.
- **Sample space:** list of all possible outcomes eg positive or negative for malaria
- **Event:** the subset of the sample space eg positive for malaria

**Example:**

> One flip of a fair coin = experiment
> Outcome = Head/Tail
> Sample space = H, T
> If we flip a fair coin twice, what is the probability of getting at least one head?
> Sample space = HH, HT, TH, TT
> Event (A) = at least one head
> 𝑛 = 3; 𝑁=4
> 𝑝(𝐴) = 3/4 = 0 . 7 5

## Probability rules

**Mutually exclusive events:** Two events are mutually exclusive if the occurrence of one event excludes the occurrence of the other E.g. If a baby is male, it can’t be female also or if a patient is malaria positive, he
can’t be malaria negative

The probability of occurrence of two mutually exclusive events is the probability of either one of the two events occurring, denoted by `𝑝(𝐴) ∪ 𝑝(𝐵) = 𝑝(𝐴) + 𝑝(𝐵)` (add individual probabilities): ∪ (union)

```Example
200 children tested for Entamoeba histolytica , where 59 are positive & 141 are
negative
Probability of E. histolytica positivity = 59/200 = 0.295
Probability of E. histolytica negativity = 141/200 = 0.705
Probability of being positive or negative for E. histolytica = 0.295 + 0.705 = 1
```

**Independent events:** Two events are independent if the occurrence of one event does not influence/does not exclude the occurrence of the other – denoted by 𝑝(𝐴) ∩ 𝑝(𝐵). E.g. if the firstborn child is male, this doesn’t influence the sex of the second born (can be male or female), co-morbidity g HTN + DM: ∩ (combination)

The probability of two independent events is obtained by multiplying individual probabilities of the events `𝑝(𝐴)∩𝑝(𝐵)=𝑝(𝐴) × 𝑝(𝐵)`

**Example**

In a blood bank the following distribution of blood groups was observed.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>

</div>

What is the probability that the next 2 persons will be in blood group O?

𝑝(𝐴)∩𝑝(𝐵) =0.45 × 0.45=0.2025 ≅𝟎.𝟐𝟎

Next 4 persons: 0.45 × 0.45 × 0.45 × 0.45 (chances decreases)

## Important probability distributions

Probabilities can be assigned to each likely outcome for a variable. These probabilities usually follow a mathematical formula called **a probability distribution.**

The probability distribution of a variable depends on the type of variable:

- **Continuous variables:** – temperature, weight, height: follow a **Normal distribution**
- **Nominal/Binary (yes/no) variables:** sex, disease, death: follow a **Binomial distribution**
- **Discrete or rare occurrences:** death, rare diseases, counts: follow a **Poisson distribution**

## Normal probability distribution

All normally distributed variables are **_continuous but not all continuous variable_** are normally distributed eg income is a continuous variable but not normally distributed (skewed/outliers present).

For continuous variables all values within a certain range are observable and the probability associated with one such observation is negligibly small such that on a continuous scale a **zero probability** is assigned to individual points eg if range of
weight in a population is 50-90kg, the probability of getting exact 57kg is negligible (0), they could be 57.4 may be.

However, we can calculate the probability that a variable will take a value between two points e.g. 𝑎 and 𝑏. Eg probability of being between 60 and 65kg.

For continuous variables a **probability density** is defined – mathematical function such that area under curve between 2 points 𝑎 and 𝑏 is equal to the probability that the variable will take a value between these 2 points

Two important parameters are needed to calculate probabilities from the normal probability density:

- **Mean (𝜇)** – locates the central position
- **Variance (𝜎<sup>2</sup>)** or its square root, the **standard deviation (𝜎)** measures the degree of spread about the mean

If the **𝜇** and **𝜎** of a normally distributed variable are known, we can determine the probability that such a variable will take a value that lies between 2 points **𝑎** and **𝑏**.

</div>

To estimate the probability for a normally distributed variable, we normally standardize the variable into a **standard normal deviate 𝑍 (z score)** which has a **_mean 0_** and **_variance 1_**:

</div>

Such that:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/H90dqHj.png" alt="z-score" />
</div>

- Area under the curve is 1 or 100%

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/AT1UwKU.png" alt="normal-curve" />
</div>

- **99.7%** covers **3 SD** on either side of the mean
- **68%** covers **2 SD** on either side of the mean

**Example:**

The variable birth weight is known to be normally distributed with a mean of 3100𝑔 and variance of 2500𝑔<sup>2</sup>. What is the probability that a baby will weigh greater than 3000𝑔? (First draw the probability distribution)

<div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'right' }}>

</div>

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'left' }}>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/zjO2N6G.png" alt="normal" />
</div>
</div>

The calculated 2.0 is the Z score, read off from the 2 tail probability table, what is obtained is the probability at the tail.

Probability less than 3000g = **0.02275**

Probability 3000 g = **0**

Probability between 3000-3200g

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MAxWsCK.png" alt="probability" />
</div>

1 - (0.02275 x 2) = 0.9545

## Binomial probability distribution

Important for calculating the **probability of disease (binary variables)** eg **incidence**. The binomial distribution describes the behavior of a random variable **𝑋** if the following conditions apply:

- The no. of observations **𝑛** is fixed
- Each observation is independent
- Each observation represents one of two outcomes (“success [𝑌]” or “failure”)
- The probability of success 𝜋 is the same for each outcome

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/EMK0dG4.png" alt="binomial" />
</div>

The binomial equation:

**P** = probability

**Y** = success

**𝑦** = no. of successes after 𝑛 trials

**𝑛** = no. of trials/observations

**𝜋** = probability of success on a single trial

**1-𝜋** = probability of failure

**n-y** = no. of failure

**(n y) factorial** = use calculator to obtain: eg **10ncr5**

If the conditions described above are met then 𝑿 is said to have a binomial distribution with parameters 𝝅 and 𝒏

**Example**

According to CDC, 22% of adults in the United States smoke. Suppose we take a sample of 10 people.What is the probability that 5 of them will smoke? ; binomial (smoke or not smoke).

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MnVrXQN.png" alt="binomial" />
</div>

What is the probability that 2 or less will be smokers? No smokers, 1 or 2 smokers.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/rIALMOx.png" alt="binomial" />
</div>

What is the probability that at least one will smoke? Probability of at least one (excludes 0) being a smoker = 1 − 𝑝(𝑌 = 0)

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/8h5DoCh.png" alt="binomial" />
</div>

The mean and variance of a binomial distribution (for qualitative variable) can be shown to be:

**𝜇** = **𝑛𝜋** (I.e number of success)

**𝜎2** = **𝑛𝜋** (1 − 𝜋) (I.e number of success X failure)

For large values of 𝑛 the distribution of the binomial variable 𝑋 and the proportion 𝜋 are approximately normal. Hence, a normal approximation to binomial distribution (can use normal distribution for this variable) is possible when:

- **𝑛𝜋 ≥ 5**
- **𝑛𝜋(1 − 𝜋) ≥ 5**

**Example**
If the probability of a certain disease is thought to be 0.2. What is the probability that in a sample of 50 individuals, 20 or more will get the disease?

𝜋 = 0.2

𝑛 = 50

𝑛𝜋 = 50 × 0.2 = 10

𝑛𝜋(1−𝜋) =50 × 0.2 x (1−0.2) = 8

Hence normal approximation to Binomial distribution is possible:

## Poisson probability distribution

The Poisson distribution is a **discrete probability distribution** for the **_counts (or rates) [eg incident rate]_** of events that occur rarely or randomly (can’t predict when they will happen e.g. time to next phone call) in a given interval of time or space.

If 𝑌 = the no. of events (eg phone call) in a given interval (eg 1 hour) and if the mean no. of events per interval is 𝜆, the probability of observing y events (eg 5 phone calls) in a given interval is given by:

</div>

**Example**
Births in a hospital occur randomly at an average of 1.8 births per hour. What is the probability of observing 4 births in a given hour at the hospital?
(Denominator is 4 factorial)
