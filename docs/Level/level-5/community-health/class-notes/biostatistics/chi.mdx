# Chi Square

Dr Mweu

It is a significance test of association between **two categorical variables**. Association means that knowing the value of one variable tells us something about the value of the other variable

Two variables are said to be associated if the distribution of one variable varies according to the value of the other variable

###### Example:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bazg8eD.png" alt="chi" />
</div>

In the example, ethnic group (predictor) & water source (outcome) are associated if the distribution of water source varies between the ethnic groups

###### Hypothesis

H<sub>0</sub> = No association i. e. distribution of water usage is same regardless of ethnic group
H<sub>a</sub> = There is an association i. e. distribution of water usage differs across the ethnic groups

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/oWI7dzn.png" alt="chi" />
</div>
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ltiNvO0.png" alt="chi" />
</div>

**8. 46 < 9. 49 so accept H<sub>0</sub> that there is no assocition betwn water usage and ethnicity**

## Uses of x<sup>2</sup>

- If total sample size n > 40 and smallest expected value ≥ 5
- If n is between 20 & 40 and smallest expected value is at least 5

Otherwise use **Fisher’s exact test**
