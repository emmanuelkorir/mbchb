# Health Education Process

## Steps in Health Education Process

- Assessing needs
- Developing objectives
- Planning & implementing
- Evaluation
- Documentation

## Community Health Assessment

Community diagnosis​- Assessment of a community to identify the needs and key issues through a systematic, comprehensive data collection and analysis. ​

Key elements:​

- Collaboration and shared ownership of processes​
- Community engagement​
- Defining community​
- Robust evidence base​
- Monitoring and evaluation​
- Help in developing interventions​
- Justifying resource allocation​
- Evaluating and improving interventions

### The Planning Process

- Define the community
- Information gathering/analysis
- Define the problem
- Set objectives(prioritize)
- Selecting appropriate methods(develop indicators)
- Implement intervention
- Monitor & evaluate
- Replan

#### Define the community

Describe the geographic community (can be inclusive)​. County? School? Neighborhood? ​What is the population group of interest?​ Characteristics of interest?​ Age? Gender? Income level?​ Target group of interest? E.g. ​University students, underserved adults, community exposed to a particular environmental risk​

#### Information gathering/ data collection

Information MUST be based on an understanding of the community (CURRENT) and its needs​. Qualitative data – lived experiences of the community members.​ Quantitative data – demographic characteristics and other health data​. Data sources: can be primary or secondary​.

- Primary data collection – ethics and gaining access to community. Appropriate method of data collection. Key-informant interviews, FGDs, surveys?​
- Secondary data – dataset may depend on your definition of community. Some sources include: national surveys, registries

#### Define & the prioritize problems

Community/ stakeholder participation in prioritization is important​. Create criteria for prioritization. Can be based on consideration of:​

- Needs among vulnerable groups​
- The root cause of other problems​
- Concerns of the community​
- Alignment with resources/ priorities in place​
- Severity​

Select priorities and build consensus among stakeholders – voting, strategy lists, prioritization matrix, nominal group technique, Hanlon method​. Validate priorities

#### Setting goals, objectives & strategies

Engage relevant stakeholders in this process e.g. community members, development partners, government agencies etc​. Assess the available resources:​ Resources within the community – community ownership​, resources from outside the community​, health education resources e.g. local media/ mass media​. Identify preferred strategy:​ Practice or intervention​.

Level of prevention:

- Primary (population wide intervention addressing SDH)
- Secondary (target at-risk groups)
- Tertiary (focus on diagnosed individuals)​

Level of intervention?​ Type of intervention – could be **_clinical preventive (eg using CHW to support an intervention)_** or **_population wide (consider your definition of community. Interventions can be at policy level)_**​. Best approach to intervention e.g. Systems approach? Settings based approach?

#### Setting goals, objectives & strategies

Define your specific goals and objectives – SMART ​

- Specific​
- Measurable​
- Achievable​
- Realistic​
- Time-bound

#### Implementation

Put your strategy into action​. Community engagement​. Establish an implementation strategy: ​What steps are to be taken​? Who is responsible for each step​? What resources will be needed​? Time frame​? What outcomes will you be measuring?

#### Evaluate

An iterative process​. Established baseline – understand the impact of your intervention based on identified priorities and the goals, objectives and strategies in place​
Measures/ indicators: ​

- Health behaviors such as healthy eating; ​
- Health policy changes; BMI; ​
- Vaccination uptake​
  Credible evidence:​
- Consider sources of data, indicators used, quality and quantity of data​
- Process indicators ​
- Short-term/ immediate outcomes​
- Outcomes – long term​
  Report and disseminate
