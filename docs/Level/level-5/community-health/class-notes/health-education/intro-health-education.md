# Introduction to Health Education

Veronica Sanda Ojiambo, Tutorial Fellow, UoN

## Diet & NCD Prevention

Obesity: largely driven by high energy diets and physical inactivity​

WHO Best Buy recommendations:​

- Fiscal intervention – SSB Taxation​

- Restrictions on child-directed marketing​

- Food reformulation​

- Front of Pack nutrition labelling​

- Support individuals to make healthier food choices​

- At public health level, education is fundamental

### What are some reasons why you opt to eat junk food?

- Optimal defaults – changes in the food environment which make the healthier option the easier option​
- Regulation – does food marketing influence dietary patterns? (think about tobacco regulation)​
- Economics – affordability of junk food and sugar-sweetened beverages. How can we intervene through policy?​
- Education – can we empower individuals with knowledge on healthy diets?​

### Example 1 Stimulus Control

Recap the conditioning theory. Stimulus leading to response. At the individual level, look at the food environment around you. Example: modify the visual cues in your environment.

### Example Study: STEPs Intervention

Stages to healthy eating patterns study. Study population: middle-aged adults with CVD risk factors. Aim: Examine the effectiveness of printed, tailored, iterative dietary feedback delivered by mail in improving short-term dietary behavior-saturated fat, fruits, vegetable, and grain and cereal intake.

Methods: 3 months RCT with pre- and post-test, 7 day est. Dietary records:

- Tailored, iterative, printed dietary feedback (TF)
- Small nutrition education sessions (GE)
- Control group

## Transtheoretical Model/The Cycle of Change

#### Prochaska & DiClemente

- Precontemplation. A logical starting point for the model, where there is no intention of changing behavior, the person may be unaware that a problem exists.
- Contemplation. The person becomes aware that there is a problem exists, but has made no commitment to change.
- Preparation. The person is intent on taking aciton to correct the problem, usually requires buy-in from the client(i.e the client is convinced that the change is good) and increased self-efficacy(ie the client believes s/he can make change)
- Action. The person is in active modification of behavior
- Maintenance. Sustained change occurs and new behavior(s) replaces old ones. Per this model, this stage is transitional.
- Relapse. The person falls back to old patterns of behavior.
- Upward spiral. Each time a person goes through the cycle, they learn from each relapse and (hopefully) grow stronger so that relapse is shorter or less devastating.

## Physical activity interventions

Interventions typically combine behavioral and social strategies and different channels of communication e.g. telehealth, pedometers​. Develop skills for goal setting, building physical activity, and develop strategies to ensure people achieve maintenance​. Address social and environmental factors to facilitate behavior change​. Employ strategies such as goal setting (SMART), self-regulation, feedback, reinforcement​

**Social cognitive theory** – encourage self-reinforcement and self-efficacy with the idea that reinforcement contingencies increase the likelihood of people engaging in a desired behavior

## Socio-ecological model PA

- **Intrapersonal health behaviors(ie healthcare utilization):** Age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, disease burden, insurance, education
- **Interpersonal:** Social networks, culture, time & geography constraints.
- **Neighborhood environment perceptions:** physical environment, perceptions, social cohesion, violence.
- **Neighborhood/Community:** Clinic & Hospital availability, safety & violence, physical & social environments, socioeconomic characteristics.
- **Public policy:** Public health campaigns, clinic & hospital resource allocation, clinical guidelines, insurance programs.

## Recap Behavioral theory

Freedom and choice is important as individuals. ​Health is the property/ responsibility of a person. ​What if people don’t make “responsible” choices? What if they don’t have the capacity to? Are they to blame?​ Is it just common sense? Knowledge and behavior are enough to guide behavior?​

Theory cannot give us absolute understanding but is intended to improve your understanding​. You can use theory to try to predict or explain why people behavior a certain type of way. You can use theory to develop interventions intended for change​. It is a guide however we need to be sensitive about context (culture, SES etc) and your background as an educator.
