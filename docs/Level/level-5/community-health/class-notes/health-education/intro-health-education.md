# Introduction to Health Education

Veronica Sanda Ojiambo, Tutorial Fellow, UoN

## Diet & NCD Prevention

Obesity: largely driven by high energy diets and physical inactivity​

WHO Best Buy recommendations:​

- Fiscal intervention – SSB Taxation​

- Restrictions on child-directed marketing​

- Food reformulation​

- Front of Pack nutrition labelling​

- Support individuals to make healthier food choices​

- At public health level, education is fundamental

### What are some reasons why you opt to eat junk food?

- Optimal defaults – changes in the food environment which make the healthier option the easier option​
- Regulation – does food marketing influence dietary patterns? (think about tobacco regulation)​
- Economics – affordability of junk food and sugar-sweetened beverages. How can we intervene through policy?​
- Education – can we empower individuals with knowledge on healthy diets?​

### Example 1 Stimulus Control

Recap the conditioning theory. Stimulus leading to response. At the individual level, look at the food environment around you. Example: modify the visual cues in your environment.

### Example Study: STEPs Intervention

Stages to healthy eating patterns study. Study population: middle-aged adults with CVD risk factors. Aim: Examine the effectiveness of printed, tailored, iterative dietary feedback delivered by mail in improving short-term dietary behavior-saturated fat, fruits, vegetable, and grain and cereal intake.

Methods: 3 months RCT with pre- and post-test, 7 day est. Dietary records:

- Tailored, iterative, printed dietary feedback (TF)
- Small nutrition education sessions (GE)
- Control group

## Transtheoretical Model/The Cycle of Change

#### Prochaska & DiClemente

- Precontemplation. A logical starting point for the model, where there is no intention of changing behavior, the person may be unaware that a problem exists.
- Contemplation. The person becomes aware that there is a problem exists, but has made no commitment to change.
- Preparation. The person is intent on taking aciton to correct the problem, usually requires buy-in from the client(i.e the client is convinced that the change is good) and increased self-efficacy(ie the client believes s/he can make change)
- Action. The person is in active modification of behavior
- Maintenance. Sustained change occurs and new behavior(s) replaces old ones. Per this model, this stage is transitional.
- Relapse. The person falls back to old patterns of behavior.
- Upward spiral. Each time a person goes through the cycle, they learn from each relapse and (hopefully) grow stronger so that relapse is shorter or less devastating.

## Physical activity interventions

Interventions typically combine behavioral and social strategies and different channels of communication e.g. telehealth, pedometers​. Develop skills for goal setting, building physical activity, and develop strategies to ensure people achieve maintenance​. Address social and environmental factors to facilitate behavior change​. Employ strategies such as goal setting (SMART), self-regulation, feedback, reinforcement​

**Social cognitive theory** – encourage self-reinforcement and self-efficacy with the idea that reinforcement contingencies increase the likelihood of people engaging in a desired behavior

## Socio-ecological model PA

- **Intrapersonal health behaviors(ie healthcare utilization):** Age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, disease burden, insurance, education
- **Interpersonal:** Social networks, culture, time & geography constraints.
- **Neighborhood environment perceptions:** physical environment, perceptions, social cohesion, violence.
- **Neighborhood/Community:** Clinic & Hospital availability, safety & violence, physical & social environments, socioeconomic characteristics.
- **Public policy:** Public health campaigns, clinic & hospital resource allocation, clinical guidelines, insurance programs.

## Recap Behavioral theory

Freedom and choice is important as individuals. ​Health is the property/ responsibility of a person. ​What if people don’t make “responsible” choices? What if they don’t have the capacity to? Are they to blame?​ Is it just common sense? Knowledge and behavior are enough to guide behavior?​

Theory cannot give us absolute understanding but is intended to improve your understanding​. You can use theory to try to predict or explain why people behavior a certain type of way. You can use theory to develop interventions intended for change​. It is a guide however we need to be sensitive about context (culture, SES etc) and your background as an educator.

### Health belief model (HBM)

The health belief model (HBM) is a social psychological health behavior change model developed to explain and predict health-related behaviors, particularly in regard to the uptake of health services. The HBM suggests that people's beliefs about health problems, perceived benefits of action and barriers to action, and self-efficacy explain engagement (or lack of engagement) in health-promoting behavior. A stimulus, or cue to action, must also be present in order to trigger the health-promoting behavior.

#### Perceived susceptibility

Perceived susceptibility refers to subjective assessment of risk of developing a health problem. The HBM predicts that individuals who perceive that they are susceptible to a particular health problem will engage in behaviors to reduce their risk of developing the health problem. Individuals with low perceived susceptibility may deny that they are at risk for contracting a particular illness. Others may acknowledge the possibility that they could develop the illness, but believe it is unlikely. Individuals who believe they are at low risk of developing an illness are more likely to engage in unhealthy, or risky, behaviors. Individuals who perceive a high risk that they will be personally affected by a particular health problem are more likely to engage in behaviors to decrease their risk of developing the condition.

#### Perceived severity

Perceived severity refers to the subjective assessment of the severity of a health problem and its potential consequences. The HBM proposes that individuals who perceive a given health problem as serious are more likely to engage in behaviors to prevent the health problem from occurring (or reduce its severity). Perceived seriousness encompasses beliefs about the disease itself (e.g., whether it is life-threatening or may cause disability or pain) as well as broader impacts of the disease on functioning in work and social roles. For instance, an individual may perceive that influenza is not medically serious, but if he or she perceives that there would be serious financial consequences as a result of being absent from work for several days, then he or she may perceive influenza to be a particularly serious condition.

#### Perceived benefits

Perceived benefits refer to an individual's assessment of the value or efficacy of engaging in a health-promoting behavior to decrease risk of disease. If an individual believes that a particular action will reduce susceptibility to a health problem or decrease its seriousness, then he or she is likely to engage in that behavior regardless of objective facts regarding the effectiveness of the action.

#### Perceived barriers

Perceived barriers refer to an individual's assessment of the obstacles to behavior change. Even if an individual perceives a health condition as threatening and believes that a particular action will effectively reduce the threat, barriers may prevent engagement in the health-promoting behavior. Perceived barriers to taking action include the perceived inconvenience, expense, danger (e.g., side effects of a medical procedure) and discomfort (e.g., pain, emotional upset) involved in engaging in the behavior. For instance, lack of access to affordable health care and the perception that a flu vaccine shot will cause significant pain may act as barriers to receiving the flu vaccine.

#### Modifying variables

Individual characteristics, including demographic, psychosocial, and structural variables, can affect perceptions (i.e., perceived seriousness, susceptibility, benefits, and barriers) of health-related behaviors. Demographic variables include age, sex, race, ethnicity, and education, among others. Psychosocial variables include personality, social class, and peer and reference group pressure, among others.

#### Cues to action

The HBM posits that a cue, or trigger, is necessary for prompting engagement in health-promoting behaviors. Cues to action can be internal or external. Physiological cues (e.g., pain, symptoms) are an example of internal cues to action. External cues include events or information from close others, the media, or health care providers promoting engagement in health-related behaviors

#### Self-efficacy

Self-efficacy refers to an individual's perception of his or her competence to successfully perform a behavior.Confidence in one's ability to effect change in outcomes (i.e., self-efficacy) was a key component of health behavior change.
