# Behavior Change Strategies

## Definitions

### Contingency contracts

A contingency contract is a written agreement that specifies the relationship between a target behavior and its consequences. It contains three basic elements: (1) the target behavior is specified in specific, clear terms; (2) the consequences for performing (or failing to perform) the target behavior are clearly stated, (3) the contingency is clearly specified (i.e. if the individual does X, they get Y).

Example:A contingency contract could be used to increase medication adherence. If the individual takes the medication once a day for at least 25 out of 30 days of the month, he or she will treat himself or herself to dinner at a nice restaurant. For each day the individual does not take the medication, he or she will send $5 to his or her least favorite charity.

### Token economy

One of the most commonly used behavior management interventions is the points/token economy system. A point system or token economy involves awarding reinforcing objects (or “reinforcers”) --e.g., tokens, chips, stickers, check marks, points, stars, or other items/markings for performance of desired behaviors. Individuals may periodically exchange the tokens/points for rewards, which are items or activities desirable to them (e.g. TV time, dinner at a nice restaurant, buying expensive item). These programs are often compared to a national economic system in which we work for money, which has no value in and of itself,\*and later exchange it foritems and activities that are valuable to us.

Example:An individual who wants to increase their vegetable consumption awards himself or herself one token per serving of vegetables. He or she creates a list of rewards that he or she can “spend” her tokens on (e.g., 30 minutes of television = 5 tokens, fancy coffee drink = 20 tokens, massage = 50 tokens).\*Secondary reinforcersare items that have no inherent value in and of themselves, but are exchanged for other items of value. The best example of a secondary reinforce is money, but other forms are used widely in education (e.g., stars or points toward a prize).

### Stimulus control

Stimulus control is a term used to describe situations in which a behavior is triggered by the presence or absence of some stimulus. In this scenario, an antecedentstimulus evokes a certain behavior. This is different from other methods that reinforce a behavior after it has occurred (e.g. watching TV as a reward for running).

Example:An individual always snacks on chips while watching TV. Over time, watching TV evokes the behavior of eating chips.

In practice the behavior change strategy of using “stimulus control” proceduresis used to describe the process of “unlearning” associations between settings or cues and health behaviors. For example, it is known that situations can trigger cravings for food and even addictive substances. So, if one is trying to quit smoking, a stimulus control proceduremight be used to reduce the number of associated triggers for smoking. For example, the individual might set a precedent whereby she is only allowed to smoke outdoors. In this way, the situations or “triggers” typically associated with smoking will become uncoupled with the behavior itself. In this manner, smoking inside while watching TV would, over time, be less likely to elicit a craving for cigarettes.

## Strategies to increase behaviors:

### 1. Reinforcement / Reward

Positive reinforcement is what most people think of when they hear the word "reward". This type of situation occurs when you provide a desired thing for completing a certain behavior.Example:An individual exercises for an hour, and as a reward, he or she watches an episode of his or her favorite TV show.

### Premack Principle

Preferred behaviors that are often engaged in (i.e., high probabilitybehaviors) can be used to reinforce unpreferred, less frequent (i.e., low probability) behaviors. The Premack principle states that if a higher-probability behavior can only be engaged in if a lower-probability behavior is completed, the frequency of the lower-probability behavior will increase.

Example:An individual always eats dessert after dinner but rarely eats a salad with dinner. If the individual can only have dessert if she eats a salad at dinner, she is likely to eat salad at dinner more often.

### Prompting

Prompts are cues that can remind or instruct an individual to perform the target behavior. Cues can take a variety of forms, such as environmental (e.g., sign stating “Am I really hungry?” on the fridge) or behavioral (e.g., learning to use tense muscles as a cue to engage in meditation).

Example:An individual who wants to snack on healthier items puts a list of healthy snacks on their fridge and cupboard doors to remind themselves to choose one of these items.

### Shaping

Behavior changes are often challenging in nature, requiring effort and practice to achieve. For example, it is not possible to run a marathon without training for it. Shaping refers to the reinforcement of behaviors that approximate or come close to the desired new behavior. The steps involved are often called successive approximations because they successively approximate or get closer and closer to the desired behavior.

Example: An individual who wants to start running might first reward himself or herself for just putting on exercise clothes and tennis shoes. Next, he or she would reward himself or herself for going on a walk in their exercise clothes. Later, he or she would reward himself or herself for running for 2 minutes, slowly increasing the amount of time he or she needs to run to receive the reward.

## Strategies to decrease behaviors:

### Reinforcement of competing behaviors

Reinforcement of competing behavior is a technique in which one would identify a behavior that competes with the ability to engage in an undesirable target behavior, thereby decreasing the frequency of the target behavior. The reinforcement aspect of this strategy refers to the idea of
increasing the new, competingbehavior by either contingently adding a pleasant stimulus if the incompatible behavior is (positive reinforcement) or removing an aversive stimulus if the incompatible behavior is completed (negative reinforcement).

Example: An individual will receive reinforcement for taking ashower instead of eating junk food when stressed. Taking a shower competes with one’s ability to consume junk food because of the presence of water and because one must use his or her hands for washing rather than eating.

### Response cost

Response cost is the withdrawal of specified amounts of reinforcerimmediately after the production of a challenging behavior. Often, it is used in conjunction with a "token economy," in which an individual earns tokens for engaging in desirable behaviors.

Example: An individual may agree to lost money if he or she engages in a target behavior. For example, if someone is trying to limit the amount of time watching TV, then he or she could agree to pay $10 if more than an hour of TV is watched. To increase the potency of this intervention, the individual may agree to givethat $10 to a charity that he or she despises, thereby increasing the motivation to turn the TV off within an hour and avoid the cost.

### Removal of reinforcers (aka time out)

Removal of reinforces refers to a technique aimed at decreasing target behavior by taking away a positive stimulus. A common example of this approach is time out where children are removed from the environment and forced to sit without exposure to positive stimuli. In doing so, the target behavior becomes associated with the loss of enjoyable stimuli. Thus, to avoid the removal of enjoyable stimuli, one may no longer engage in the undesirable behavior.

Example: An individual is trying to decrease the consumption of soda. This student normally enjoys watching Netflix before bed. However, he or she agrees to not watch Netflix if he or she consumes a soda that day. Thus, a positive stimulus is taken away if the target behavior is completed.

### Punishment

Punishment is a technique designed to decrease a target behavior by adding an aversivestimulus when one engages in said behavior. A common example among children is spanking, whereby one may spank a child if he or she engages in an undesirable behavior. Engaging in this behavior becomes associated with the presence of the aversive stimulus. One may therefore elect to not engage in the target behavior in order to avoid exposure to the aversive stimulus.

Example: An individual is trying to decrease the amount of time spent on Facebook. He or she asks his roommates to help with accountability and agrees to completing all of the household chores if more than an hour is spent on Facebook each day.

### Aversives

Aversives are unpleasantstimulithat induce changes in behaviorthrough punishment. Similar to general punishment principles, this strategy works by applying an aversive immediately following a behavior, thereby reducing the likelihood of the behavior occurring in the future. Aversives is a more nuanced version of punishment by focusing, in particular, on negative physical sensations.

Example: If an individual is attempting to stop smoking, then he or she may elect to take a nausea-producing drug that induces nausea when a cigarette is consumed. Via classical conditioning, the behavior of smoking becomes associated with the aversive physical sensation (nausea). Thus, the individual is likely to stop smoking in order to avoid the nausea that has become paired with smoking behavior.
