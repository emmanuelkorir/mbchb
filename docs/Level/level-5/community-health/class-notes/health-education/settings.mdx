# Health Settings Approach

Veronica Ojiambo

A socioecological strategy for health promotion.

### Ottawa charter (WHO, 1986)

Health is created and lived within settings of everyday
life. A goal of health promotion is to stain self reliance within a supportive
environment. All settings of social life and activity should provide greater
opportunities for promoting health.

Building concern for health into the fabric of the system and into the
routine activities of the system (Naidoo & Wills, 2000). It draws on community

(Smith 2000). Joined up action across settings is essential to maximize the public
health contribution, via a ‘whole systems’ approach (Dooris, 2004)

Some examples of healthy settings: the place or social context in which people
