**Health literacy:** implies the achievement of a level of knowledge, personal skills, and confidence to take action to improve personal and community health by changing personal lifestyles an driving conditions. Thus, health literacy means more than being able to read phamphlets and make appointments. By improving people's access to health information and their capacity to use it effectively, health literacy is critical to empowerment. - _Health Promotoion, 1998._

## Effective Messaging

- **Superficial messages** - do not address the actual barriers to desired health behaviors
- Lack of **targeted messaging** strategies ie children vs adults
- **Authoritarian/directive** techniques rather than empathetic ones
- **Long-term vs short-term** focus
- **Negative(fear-mongering/shame)** vs positive messaging
- **Facts vs emotions**
- **Complicated vs simplified** messaging

## Framing Theory

People more motivated by emotions than fact.

## Knowledge Deficit Fallacy

- Information is important but not always the most important thing.
- Knowledge bucket fallacy- whay you say as an expert is does not always translate into practice.
- Consider socio-cultural barriers to action

## Influences on health and behavior

Insert scenario:

- Structural issues?
- Economic issues?
- Access to health services?
- Organizational policies?
- Knowledge?
- Beliefs & attitude?

## Strategies for better communication

Important to identify the barriers to communication and begin to consider the best strategies to address them.

As an educator, it is important to understand how you differ from your audience in terms of literacy, understanding of preferred sources of information, faith attitudes and belief.

Communication skills of health practitioners - have they been trained in health literacy, plain language and culturally competent.

## Emotion & behavior

We are wired to connect with people, not ideas.

Find out what matters to your audience.

Find ways to appeal to the interest of your audience: what is in it for me?

Align/frame your messages with positive outcomes for your audience.

Make them feel something: hope, excitement, horror, disgust

## Types of Communication

1. One way communication

- Linear
- No feedback
- Common in advertising and is used to persuade the receiver of the message to
  adopt a behavior prescribed by the sender of the message
- Sender - message - channel - receiver

2. Two way communication

- Complex messages
- Sender - Message - Channel - Receiver - Feedback - Sender
- Feedback mechanisms allow for an understanding of how the messages sent
  by the sender are being received and how the messaging can be adapted to
  better serve the receiverâ€™s needs.

### Gaining your audiences attention

- It is important so that audiences can pay attention to your communication
- There are complex mixtures of messages audiences are exposed to daily... need to ensure they can focus on a particular one
- Failures may include audiences not noticing or paying attention to a billboard, switching the TV or radio station
- How can you increase engagement?
- Enhance physical characteristics like color, images, sounds
- Use characters, personalities, entertainment, human
- Reflect community interests

## Summary

- Health literacy is an important consideration o You need to identify and address barriers for communication in order to be effective o Use channels which connect with audiences
  e.g. testimonials, stories, music etc.
- Audiences differ from the health communicator
- Resources are scarce so target
