# Misuse of alcohol and non communicable diseases

Dr Tom Owele

**Misuse of Alcohol:** A spectrum of behaviors, including risky (excessive) alcohol use, alcohol
abuse, or alcohol dependence. Risky or excessive alcohol use means drinking amounts of
alcohol that result in increased risk of poor health outcomes.

## Alcoholism/Alcohol Dependence

Also described as **Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)**.

Any condition that results in the continued consumption of alcoholic beverage, despite health
problems and negative social consequences. Disease and addiction which results in a
persistent use of alcohol despite negative consequences. Described as alcohol abuse combined
with tolerance, withdrawal, and an uncontrollable drive to drink (negative reinforcement due to fear of withdrawal symptoms).

## ICD - 10: Alcohol dependence syndrome

A chronic disease in which a person craves drinks that contain alcohol and is unable to
control his or her drinking. A person with this disease also needs to drink greater amounts to
get the same effect and has withdrawal symptoms after stopping alcohol use.
Alcoholic??

Drinking in the moderate or low-risk range is permissible i.e. for:

- Women at no more than three drinks in any one day and no more than seven drinks per
  week.
- Men at no more than four drinks a day and no more than 14 drinks per week.
  Habitual consumption of alcohol above these levels, is considered alcoholism and one is
  considered an alcoholic

## Risk factors for Misuse of Alcohol

1. Family history: It is well established that alcohol dependence runs in families.
   Offspring of parents with alcohol dependence are four times more likely to develop
   alcohol dependence (Goldman et al., 2005).
2. Psychological factors: Contribute to the risk of developing alcohol-use disorders.
   Alcohol; a psychoactive drug with pleasurable effects and ability to relieve negative
   mood states such as anxiety (Drummond et al., 1990) – **Conditioning theory**

Teenagers with higher positive expectancies (for example, that drinking is
pleasurable and desirable) are more likely to start drinking at an earlier age and to
drink more heavily (Christiansen et al., 1989; Dunn & Goldman, 1998) - **Social learning theory**

3. Personality factors: People who are alcohol dependent have a 21-fold higher risk of
   also having antisocial personality disorder (ASPD; Regier et al., 1990), and people
   with ASPD have a higher risk of severe alcohol dependence (Goldstein et al., 2007)
   Disinhibition traits, such as novelty and sensation seeking, and poor impulse control,
   are factors related to increased risk of both alcohol and drug dependence (Dick et al.,
   2007; Kalivas & Volkow, 2005).

4. Psychiatric comorbidity: People who are alcohol dependent have higher rates of
   comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders, particularly depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), psychosis and drug misuse, than people in the
   general population (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK65500/)
5. Stress, adverse life events and abuse: Adverse life events can trigger excessive
   drinking and may predispose to the development of alcohol dependence (Moncrieff
   et al., 1996).
6. Environmental and cultural factors: Other environmental factors that predispose to
   the development of alcohol-use disorders (Cook, 1994) include:

   - Affordability and availability of alcohol,
   - High consumption rates in the general population,
   - Occupational risk factors (such as working in the alcohol or hospitality
     industries), ✓Social pressure to drink, and
   - Religious- and culturally-related attitudes towards alcohol.

## Prevalence of Misuse of Alcohol in Kenya

- 19.3% of Kenyans drink alcohol with 13% of these consuming alcohol daily.
- Heavy episodic drinking defined as drinking six or more drinks on a single occasion was
  reported by 12.7% of Kenyans.
  (Kenya STEPwise survey for Non-Communicable Diseases Risk Factors | 2015 report)

## NCDs Associated with Misuse of Alcohol

- Leading risk factor for death and disability globally, accounting for 3.8% of death and 4.6%
  of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) lost in 2004
- 8th highest risk factor for death in 2004 (5th in middle-income countries and 9th in highincome countries)
- In terms of DALYs lost in 2004, alcohol ranked 3rd highest (1st in middle-income countries,
  8th highest in low-income countries and 2nd highest in high-income countries).
- Linked to cancer, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and liver disease.

### CANCER

Higher body mass index, low fruit and vegetable intake, physical inactivity,
tobacco use, alcohol use, and unsafe sex, urban and indoor air pollution, and unsafe health-care injections - jointly responsible for 35% of cancer deaths (WHO, 2009). Causal link
between alcohol and cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, liver, colon,
rectum, and female breast is well established (Baan et al, 2007; International Agency for
Research on Cancer., 2010). A dose-response relationship exists, that is, the risk of cancer
increased steadily with greater volumes of drinking (Rehm et al, 2010; IARC, 2010).
The strength of the relationship to levels of average alcohol consumption varies for different
cancers. Each additional 10 g of pure alcohol per day (10g is the weight of about 12.7 ml of
pure alcohol) is associated with an increase of 7% in the relative risk (RR) of breast cancer.
Regular consumption of approximately 50g of pure alcohol increases the relative risk of
colorectal cancer by between 10% and 20%. One of causal mechanisms for some cancers is
the toxic effect of acetaldehyde, a metabolite of alcohol (Brooks et al, 2007; IARC, 2010).

### CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES

Eight risk factors (alcohol use, tobacco use, high blood
pressure, high body mass index, high cholesterol, high blood glucose, low fruit and vegetable
intake, and physical inactivity) jointly account for 61% of loss of healthy life years from
CVDs and 61% of cardiovascular deaths (Charles et al, 2011).
Above risk factors together account for over 75% of deaths from ischemic and hypertensive
heart disease (WHO, 2009). Alcohol use is overwhelmingly detrimentally related to many
cardiovascular outcomes, e.g. Hypertensive disease (Taylor et al, 2009), Hemorrhagic stroke
(Patra et al, 2010), Atrial fibrillation (Samokhvalov et al, 2010)

### LIVER DISEASE

Alcohol is associated with Fatty liver, Alcoholic hepatitis and Liver
cirrhosis. The likelihood of developing liver disease is a function of both the duration and the
amount of heavy drinking (Mann et al, 2003). For men drinking 30 g of absolute alcohol per
day is associated with a RR of 2.8 of dying from liver cirrhosis (7.7 for females). For men
drinking 54 g of alcohol per day is associated with a relative risk of 2.3 for acquiring liver
cirrhosis. For both morbidity and mortality, the RR increases with the volume consumed per
day (Rehm et al, 2010).
Possible causal mechanisms - breakdown of alcohol in the liver leading to the generation of
free radicals and acetaldehyde which individually damage liver cells (Wu & Cederbaum,
2003; Tuma & Casey, 2003).

### OTHER DISEASES

Volumes greater than about 48 g/day have been found to be associated
with increased risk of pancreatitis (Irving et al, 2009). U-shaped relationship between the
average amount of alcohol consumed per day and the risk of type 2 diabetes (Baliunas et al,
2009).

- Alcohol use disorders is associated with - Alzheimer’s Diseases [OR 1.7; 95% CI
  1.1–2.8] (Rehm et al, 2019).

Approximately 10% of all dementia cases
are associated with misuse of alcohol,
making alcohol the 2nd leading cause of
dementia (Rehm et al, 2019).

Epilepsy, Polyneuropathy, Nutritional
deficiencies, Sexual dysfunction, and
deaths from many sources are also
associated with AUD

## PREVENTION AND CONTROL

In Kenya, it is guided by the Alcoholic drinks control Act of 2010 (pls review the provisions
of the act)

Poor Health, Social and Educational outcomes result from alcohol or drug dependence

Targeting adolescents and young adults (age of initiation of alcohol use) - an important step to
reduce the harm of alcohol abuse.

The framework on CSDH provides a good guideline for implementation of a national
prevention and control strategy

Management of AUD entails detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy,
attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms.
