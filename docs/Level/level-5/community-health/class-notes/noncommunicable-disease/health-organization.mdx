# Health Center Practice

Dr Tom Olewe

## Organization of Health Service Delivery in Kenya

The NHSSP (2018 - 2023) emphasizes provision of disease prevention and health promotion, at the individual and community levels.

Service delivery is thus disaggregated into four (4) tiers, namely;

- Tier I - Community health services through Community Health Units (CHU)
- Tier 2 - Dispensaries and Health (Primary care services)
- Tier 3 - Sub county and County hospital
- Tier 4 - Referral hospitals - former provincial, national/tertiary health facilities

The Kenya essential package for health (KEPH) in the second national health sector
strategic plan (NHSSP 2) described the six levels of care and defines six life cycle
cohorts.

Six levels (sometimes used concurrently with the Tier classification) of Health care delivery in Kenya:-

- LEVEL I - Community Facilities
- LEVEL 2 - Health Dispensaries
- LEVEL 3 - Health Centres
- LEVEL 4 - County Hospitals
- LEVEL 5 - County Referral Hospitals
- LEVEL 6 - National Referral Hospitals

## Health System Building Blocks

The World Health Organization recommends supporting and strengthening a health system based on the framework in
strengthening a health system means improvement of the six-health system building blocks and managing their interactions in ways that achieves more EQUITABLE and SUSTAINED improvements across HEALTH SERVICES and HEALTH
OUTCOMES

People are often listed as the seventh building block. "People" refers to individuals, households, and communities as civil society, consumers, patients, payers, and producers of health through knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and practices.

NHSSP (2018 - 2023) includes Health Infrastructure as the 7<sup>th</sup> building block

## Health System Evaluation-Basic

Here is a basic checklist for what to think about when you analyze the building blocks and recommend strengthening to the Facility, County and National leadership:

1. **Service Delivery:** Good service delivery comprises quality, access, safety and coverage.
2. **Health Workforce:** A well-performing workforce consists of human resources management, skills and policies.
3. **Health Information System:** A well performing system ensures the production, analysis, dissemination and use of timely and reliable information.

4. **Medical Products, Vaccines and Technology:** Procurement and supply programs need to ensure equitable access. assured quality and cost-effective use
5. **Health Financing:** A good health financing system raises adequate funds (OOP, PI, SI, CS, Donations, Grants [Gok County])for health, protects people from financial catastrophe, allocates resources, and purchases good and services in ways that improve quality, equity, and efficiency.
6. **Leadership and Governance:** Effective leadership and governance ensures the existence of strategic policy frameworks, effective oversight and coalition building (internal and external), provision of appropriate incentives, and attention to system design, and accountability.
7. **Health Infrastructure:** Ensure access, safety and dignity of health workers, patients and other stakeholders quality interacting with the health system.

## Assessment of the Health System

System approach is a term that means to do something systematically.

In order to improve health status of a community, we should systematically consider inputs, processes and outputs and decide objectives, indicators and modes of verification
The inputs are basically the supplies, human resources, equipment etc we put in, to undertake an activity (process)

Processes are the methods of delivery/put the input to use

Outputs are the end-product of inputs and process those must be assessed based on objectives and indicators.
