# Principles of Non-communicable Diseases Prevention and Control

Dr Olewe Tom

## Definition

A Non-communicable Disease is a disease that is not spread through an infectious agent or its pathogenic products ( non contagious, infectious).

Are caused by how people live, conditions they are born with, or environmental hazards.

Are not spread by contact because most are not caused by pathogenic agents. Instead they are caused by the breakdown in body cells and tissues.

**Degenerative Diseases:** Cause further breakdown, or degeneration in body cells and tissues as they progress

**Chronic Diseases:** Are present either continuously or off and on over a long period of time, normally for more than 3 months. May develop as a result of a person’s lifestyle, behaviors or substances in a person’s environment

###### Diseases Present at Birth

- Genetic Disorder: one in which the body does not develop or function normally because of an inherited problem
- Birth Defect: disorders of the developing and newborn baby, causes unknown.

In most cases there are no cure for either genetic disorders or birth defects

**Diseases Resulting from Lifestyle Behaviors:** Risk Factors are certain characteristics that increase a person’s chances of developing the disease. Many diseases are the direct or indirect result of harmful lifestyle behaviors. Healthful lifestyle behaviors, on the other hand, can help prevent or control certain diseases and disorders.

**Diseases Caused by the Environment:** Many diseases are caused by hazards in the environment. Examples of harmful substances that may be present in the environment: Fumes for chemicals, second hand smoke, radon, asbestos

## Surveillance needs for NCDs

Surveillance is the ongoing collection, analysis, and use of health data for the planning, implementation, and assessment of disease control—"information for action”

Characteristics of a surveillance system

- Uses of surveillance data:
- Identify extent of the problem
- Map emerging patterns and trends
- Measure progress in primary prevention
- Contribute to policy making

## NCD Risk Factor Surveillance: Focus

Risk Factor – a variable associated with an increased risk of disease or infection. Determinant is often used as a synonym.

Guide to selection of Risk factors for surveillance:

1. Associated with major NCDs (CVD, Cancers, Chronic Respiratory disease, T2DM) and amenable to interventions
2. Data collection requires simple surveillance systems.
3. Have standard definition and methods of measurement.
4. Applicable in primary prevention of NCDs.

#### Strategy for NCD surveillance

##### Causal chain of NCDs

## Types of causal relationships:

1. **Necessary and sufficient:** without the factor, dx never develops (necessary), in the presence of the factor, disease always develops (sufficient). Rarely occurs
2. **Necessary, not sufficient:** Multiple factors needed to cause dx, no individual factor is sufficient
3. **Sufficient, not necessary:** One factor alone can cause disease, but other factors acting alone can cause disease too
4. **Neither sufficient, nor necessary:** A factor by itself is neither sufficient, nor necessary to produce disease: Complex, but probably represent causal relationships in NCDs

## Measures of Association

Concept of exposed and unexposed to a risk factor

### Risk

- The probability of an outcome (often a negative outcome) in a specified period of time\*time bound.

- A quantitative estimate of risk(**attributable risk**) is useful in making decisions about a course
  of action or intervention; resources of time and money allocation.

- **Absolute Risk:** A ratio of people who have a medical event compared to all of the people who could have an event, expressed as %

For example, if 26 out of 100 people will get dementia in their lifetime, the absolute risk is 26/100 or 26%. The higher the denominator (the bottom number), the lower the absolute risk.

- **Risk Difference (Attributable risk/Excess Risk):** IR(Exposed) – IR(Unexposed) NB: incidence rate (IR)

- **Relative Risk:** e.g. longitudinal/Prospective/Cohort – recruitment based on exposure (Incidence rate of disease among exposed /Incidence rate of disease among unexposed)

- **Odds:** Probability that cases were exposed/Probability that cases were unexposed

- **Odds Ratio:** e.g. Retrospective/Case Control – recruitment based on outcome (Odds that Cases were exposed/Odds that controls were exposed)

- **RR/OR = 1** - Exposure makes no difference in quantity of outcome
- **RR/OR > 1** - Exposure associated with increased risk of outcome
- **RR/OR < 1** - Exposure could be protective

### Association and Causation

**Bradford-Hill**, otherwise known as **Hill's criteria for causation**, are a group of nine principles that can be useful in establishing epidemiological evidence of a causal relationship between a presumed cause and an observed effect:

1. **Temporal relationship:** exposure occurred before the disease \*\*outcome
2. **Strength of Association:** the stronger the association between a risk factor and outcome, the more likely the relationship is to be causal.
3. **Dose response relationship:** Change in disease rates should follow from corresponding changes in exposure
4. **Replication/Consistency of the Finding:** Have the same findings must be observed among different populations, in different study designs and different times?
5. **Biologic Plausibility:** Presence of a potential biological mechanism
6. **Consideration of alternate explanation:** Other possible explanation for the association must be looked
7. **Cessation of Exposure:** Does the removal of the exposure alter the frequency of the outcome?
8. **Consistency with other knowledge (Coherence):** Does the relationship agree with the current knowledge of the natural history/biology of the disease?
9. **Specificity of the association** - _exposure must be associated with only one disease outcome (re: defies commonality of risk factors)_ - weakest guideline

## STEPwise approach to surveillance (STEPS)

The WHO STEPwise approach to Surveillance (STEPS) is a simple, standardized method for collecting, analyzing and disseminating data in WHO member countries. Uses same standardized questions and protocols.Countries can use STEPS information for monitoring within-country trends and making comparisons across countries. The approach encourages the collection of small amounts of useful information on a regular and continuing basis.

###### Rationale for selecting risk factors:

- Greatest impact on NCD mortality and morbidity
- Modifiable by intervention
- Validated measurement
- Meaningful comparisons possible
- Measurement can be obtained following ethical standards.

STEPwise approach to NCDs risk factor surveillance (STEPS):

- **Focuses** on obtaining core data on the established risk factors that determine the major
  disease burden.
- **Flexible** allow each country to expand on the core variables and risk factors, and to incorporate optional modules related to local or regional interests.
- **Entry point** for low and middle-income countries to get started on chronic disease
  surveillance activities.
- **Designed** to help countries build and strengthen their capacity to conduct
  surveillance.

###### Levels of Risk Factor Surveillance at each Step:

</div>

The STEPS Instrument covers three different levels of "steps" of risk factor
assessment.

- Questionnaire
- Physical measurements
- Biochemical measurements

###### Sources of surveillance data collection for ncds:

1. Mortality Data
   - Medical Certificates for Death
   - Cause of Death Survey
   - Hospital Records
2. Morbidity data
   - Registry: Cancer
   - Special Surveys
   - Hospital Reports
3. Risk Factors
   - Special Surveys
