# Tobacco Use & its Association with NCDs

Dr Tom Olewe

"The single most important PREVENTABLE RISK to human health in developed
countries and an important cause of premature death worldwide” CDC, USA

"Much of the disease burden and premature mortality attributable to tobacco use
disproportionately affect the poor" WHO, GENEVA

## Tobacco Use

- Smoking: common method of consuming tobacco, the most common substance smoked.
  Often mixed with other additives eg Shisha etc.Vapors is inhaled and the active substances
  absorbed through the alveoli in the lungs. The active substances trigger chemical reactions in
  nerve endings which heighten heart rate, memory, alertness, and reaction time.
- E-electronic Cigarette: An electronic device that simulates tobacco smoking. Consists of an
  atomizer, a power source such as a battery, and a container such as a cartridge or tank. Instead
  of smoke, the user inhales vapor: "vaping”. The atomizer is a heating element that atomizes a
  liquid solution called e-liquid. E-liquid contains nicotine; could also contain other
  psychoactive products e.g. marijuana. E-cigarettes are activated by taking a puff or pressing a
  button
- Sheesha/Hookah, is tobacco mixed with molasses or honey, inhaled through water. Contains
  tobacco as in cigarettes; other additives. Smokers at risk of nicotine addition, cancer and heart
  disease. Exposure to toxic chemicals, not filtered out by the water. Risk of infectious disease
  exists: hookahs often shared.

## Pathway to Tobacco Addiction

- Contains nicotine; psychoactive chemical: causes physical and psychological dependency.
- Dopamine and later endorphins are released; associated with pleasure.
- Usually during the early stages, pleasurable sensations; **_positive reinforcement_**.
- After some individual have smoked for many years, the avoidance of **_withdrawal symptoms_**
  and **_negative reinforcement_** become the key motivations.

## Carcinogens in Tobacco

Tar is resinous, partially combusted particulate matter produced by the burning of tobacco
and other plant material in the act of smoking. Toxic and damages the smoker's lungs over time through various biochemical and mechanical processes. Damages the mouth by rotting and blackening teeth, damaging gums, and
desensitizing taste buds.

Tar includes the majority of mutagenic and carcinogenic agents in tobacco smoke. Commercial tobacco smoke is a mixture of more than 5,000 chemicals. The following are known human carcinogens found in cigarette smoke: Arsenic, cadmium, lead etc

## Mortality associated with Tobacco Use

Major public health problem worldwide and it is the single most preventable cause of
morbidity and mortality (W. H. O. Report, The, & Epidemic, 2008).

- Kills <15,000 people daily, accounting for one in six of all NCD deaths.
- Kills nearly 6 million people each year, including < 600 000 from SHS.
- An estimated 100 million people were killed by tobacco used during the 20th century.
- 80% of these deaths occur in LMIC that are still grappling with communicable diseases.
- By the end of 2020, WHO estimated that tobacco caused 7.5 million deaths annually, or about
  one in ten of all deaths.

## Effect of Tobacco use on health

1. **Cancers:** Associated with at least 16 different types of cancer. Lung cancer, the world’s
   leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for nearly one in five cancer deaths. Throat and
   oral cavity, bladder, kidney, stomach and uterine cervix.
2. **Cardiovascular diseases:** Smokeless tobacco causes hypertension and heart
   disease. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the world. Smoking increases
   the risk of heart disease and stroke by two to four times.
3. **Chronic lung diseases:** Smoking causes chronic lung diseases e.g. COPD, that can be
   severely disabling or fatal, increasing the risk of death 12 times.
4. **Type 2 diabetes mellitus:** Smoking is an **_independent_** risk factor for diabetes – up to
   12% of diabetes incidence in the United States is attributable to smoking. Diabetics who
   smoke have an increased risk of death, and of complications such as amputations and
   problems with vision.
5. **Pregnancy:**

- Ectopic pregnancy
- Miscarriage
- Pre-term delivery
- Low birthweight
- Sudden infant death syndrome.
- Smoking in pregnancy associated with an increased risk of developing gestational
  diabetes and increase the risk to their child of developing diabetes later in life.

6. **Infectious diseases:** Major risk factor for tuberculosis. More than 20% of the global
   TB incidence, and 40% in India, **_may be_** attributable to smoking. Both smoking and being
   exposed to other people’s smoke are significantly associated with TB infection, disease and
   mortality
7. **Second-hand smoke (SHS):** SHS is responsible for at least 600,000 deaths a year
   among non-smokers, with more than six in ten deaths due to heart disease. Although only
   about 20% of the world’s estimated 1 billion smokers are women, nearly half of deaths from
   SHS occur among adult women and over a quarter among children under the age of five.
   Children and infants are especially vulnerable to the effects of SHS. Exposure can lead to
   reduced lung function, increased lung infections, asthma attacks and other problems. Pregnant
   women exposed to SHS are at higher risk of preterm birth, and the growth of the baby in the
   womb can also be restricted.
8. **Impotence:** In a study of men ages 24 to 36 seeking treatment for infertility. Smoking
   harms sperm quality in every way, from longevity to motility. Smoking affected sexual
   behavior. The smokers had sex an average of 5.7 times per month, while the nonsmokers
   reported an average of 11.6 encounters. And on a scale of 1 to 10, the smokers rated the
   quality of sex at a lackluster 5.2, compared to 8.7 for nonsmokers.

## Preventing Tobacco Use through Public Health Model

This public health model is a fundamental component of epidemiology and health behavior
sciences.

Health Behavior model as a part of cues for change to he

The **_ecological systems model_**, or a **_social-environmental model_**, depicts
connections and interrelationships between people and their environments and builds on the triad.

## Preventing Tobacco Use through Public Health Model

Applied to tobacco control, it focuses attention on four priority actions:

1. Promoting a tobacco-free social norm through widespread policy changes
2. Preventing the initiation of tobacco use and thereby the development of nicotine addiction
3. Making support for quitting widely available to tobacco users
4. Protecting nonsmokers from exposure to environmental tobacco

## Preventing Tobacco Use through CSDH

Based on the ecological model, the societal phenomena, such as public policies that affect
tobacco use and health, provide a structure for designing media and policy interventions for
multiple channels and populations.

## Tobacco Cessation

Brief tobacco dependence treatment is effective.

Individual, group and telephone counseling are effective and their effectiveness increases
with treatment intensity.

Two components of counseling are especially effective when counseling patients making a
quit attempt:

- Practical counseling (problem-solving/skills training)
- Social support delivered as part of treatment.

There are numerous effective medications for tobacco dependence by all patients attempting
to quit smoking, except when medically contraindicated or with specific populations for
which there is insufficient evidence of effectiveness (i.e., pregnant women, smokeless tobacco
users, light smokers and adolescents).

## Legal framework for tobacco controL

- Kenya ratified the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 2004
- Enacted a comprehensive Tobacco Control Act (TCA) in 2007.
