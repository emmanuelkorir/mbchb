# Social Determinants of Health and Non-communicable Diseases

NCDs are caused by how people live, conditions they are born with, or environmental hazards.

**Social determinants of health (SDH):** Conditions of daily life, in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, and the wider set of forces and systems that shape them, namely:

- Economic Policies and Systems e.
- National budget, Taxation, Capitalism
- Development Agendas – Vision 2030, Big 4 Agenda
- Social Norms – cultural and societal values
- Social Policies – labour, housing, land ownership
- Political Systems – democracy Political, Economic and Social conditions influence individual and group differences in health status.

Distributions of SDH are often shaped by public policies that reflect prevailing political ideologies of the country. "This unequal distribution of health-damaging experiences is not in any sense a 'natural' phenomenon but is the result of a toxic combination of poor social policies, unfair economic arrangements [where the already well-off and healthy become even richer and the poor who are already more likely to be ill become even poorer], and bad politics."

## Elements of the CSDH Framework Structural Determinants

Social Determinants Of Health Inequities

### First element: Socio-economic and Political context

1. **Governance** in the broadest sense and its processes, including definition of needs, patterns of discrimination, civil society participation and accountability/transparence in public administration;
2. **Macroeconomic policy**, including fiscal, monetary, balance of payments and trade policies and underlying labour market structures;
3. **Social policies** affecting factors such as labor, social welfare, land and housing distribution;
4. **Public policy** in other relevant areas such as education, medical care, water and sanitation;
5. **Culture and societal values**; and
6. **Epidemiological conditions**, particularly in the case of major epidemics such as COVID-19, which exert a powerful influence on social structures and must be factored into global and national policy setting.

### Second element: Socioeconomic position (Proxy measures)

1. Income
2. Education
3. Occupation
4. Fluid: Social Class, Gender, Race/ethnicity

### Intermediary determinants

### Third element: intermediary determinants

1. Material circumstances – living and working conditions, Food availability
2. Social-environmental or psychosocial circumstances – Crowded dwellings
3. Behavioral and biological factors – Genetics, Tobacco use
4. The health system as a social determinant of health.

### A crosscutting determinant:

1. Social cohesion / social capital
