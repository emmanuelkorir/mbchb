# Primary Health Care

Dr Godia

## Definition

PHC is:

**Essential health care** based on practical, scientifically sound and **socially
acceptable** methods and technology made **universally accessible** to individuals and
families in the community through their **full participation** and at a cost that the
community and country can afford to maintain, at every stage of their
development, in the spirit of self-reliance and self-determination

PCH definition was arrived at during the International Conference on Primary Health
care **Alma – Ata – USSR, 1978** - Conference was organized by WHO and UNICEF

## Declarations of the conference includes:

1. The Conference strongly reaffirms that health, which is a state of complete
   physical, mental and social wellbeing, and not merely the absence of disease
   or infirmity, is a fundamental human right and that the attainment of the
   highest possible level of health is a most important world-wide social goal
   whose realization requires the action of many other social and economic
   sectors in addition to the health sector.

2. The existing gross inequality in the health status of the people particularly
   between developed and developing countries as well as within countries is
   politically, socially and economically unacceptable and is, therefore, of
   common concern to all countries.

3. Economic and social development, based on a New International Economic
   Order, is of basic importance to the fullest attainment of health for all and to
   the reduction of the gap between the health status of the developing and
   developed countries. The promotion and protection of the health of the
   people is essential to sustained economic and social development and
   contributes to a better quality of life and to world peace.

4. The people have the right and duty to participate individually and collectively
   in the planning and implementation of their health care.

5. Governments have a responsibility for the health of their people which can be
   fulfilled only by the provision of adequate health and social measures. A
   main social target of governments, international organizations and the whole
   world community in the coming decades should be the attainment by all
   peoples of the world by the year 2000 of a level of health that will permit
   them to lead a socially and economically productive life. Primary health care
   is the key to attaining this target as part of development in the spirit of social
   justice.

6. Primary health care is essential health care based on practical, scientifically
   sound and socially acceptable methods and technology made universally
   accessible to individuals and families in the community through their full
   participation and at a cost that the community and country can afford to
   maintain at every stage of their development in the spirit of self-reliance and
   self-determination. It forms an integral part both of the country's health
   system, of which it is the central function and main focus, and of the overall
   social and economic development of the community. It is the first level of
   contact of individuals, the family and community with the national health
   system bringing health care as close as possible to where people live and
   work, and constitutes the first element of a continuing health care process.

7. Primary health care:

- Reflects and evolves from the economic conditions and sociocultural
  and political characteristics of the country and its communities and is
  based on the application of the relevant results of social, biomedical
  and health services research and public health experience;
- Addresses the main health problems in the community, providing
  promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative services
  accordingly;
- Includes at least: education concerning prevailing health problems
  and the methods of preventing and controlling them; promotion of
  food supply and proper nutrition; an adequate supply of safe water
  and basic sanitation; maternal and child health care, including family
  planning; immunization against the major infectious diseases;
  prevention and control of locally endemic diseases; appropriate
  treatment of common diseases and injuries; and provision of essential
  drugs;
- Involves, in addition to the health sector, all related sectors and
  aspects of national and community development, in particular
  agriculture, animal husbandry, food, industry, education, housing,
  public works, communications and other sectors; and demands the
  coordinated efforts of all those sectors;
- Requires and promotes maximum community and individual self-reliance and participation in the planning, organization, operation and
  control of primary health care, making fullest use of local, national
  and other available resources; and to this end develops through
  appropriate education the ability of communities to participate;
  o Should be sustained by integrated, functional and mutually
  supportive referral systems, leading to the progressive improvement
  of comprehensive health care for all, and giving priority to those
  most in need;
  o Relies, at local and referral levels, on health workers, including
  physicians, nurses, midwives, auxiliaries and community workers as
  applicable, as well as traditional practitioners as needed, suitably
  trained socially and technically to work as a health team and to
  respond to the expressed health needs of the community.

8. All governments should formulate national policies, strategies and plans of
   action to launch and sustain primary health care as part of a comprehensive
   national health system and in coordination with other sectors. To this end, it
   will be necessary to exercise political will, to mobilize the country's resources
   and to use available external resources rationally.
9. All countries should cooperate in a spirit of partnership and service to ensure
   primary health care for all people since the attainment of health by people in
   any one country directly concerns and benefits every other country. In this
   context the joint WHO/UNICEF report on primary health care constitutes a
   solid basis for the further development and operation of primary health care
   throughout the world.
10. An acceptable level of health for all the people of the world by the year 2000
    can be attained through a fuller and better use of the world's resources, a
    considerable part of which is now spent on armaments and military conflicts.
    A genuine policy of independence, peace, détente and disarmament could and
    should release additional resources that could well be devoted to peaceful
    aims and in particular to the acceleration of social and economic development
    of which primary health care, as an essential part, should be allotted its
    proper share
    - Conference’s Call to action: the international conference on PHC calls for:
      o Urgent and effective national and international action to develop and
      implement primary health care throughout the world and particularly in
      developing countries in a spirit of technical cooperation and in keeping with a
      New International Economic Order. It urges governments, WHO and
      UNICEF, and other international organizations, as well as multilateral and
      bilateral agencies, nongovernmental organizations, funding agencies, all
      health workers and the whole world community to support national and
      international commitment to primary health care and to channel increased
      technical and financial support to it, particularly in developing countries. The
      Conference calls on all the aforementioned to collaborate in introducing,
      developing and maintaining primary health care in accordance with the spirit
      and content of this Declaration.

Primary Health Care Forms an integral part of:

- The country’s health system, of which it is the central function and main
  focus
- The overall social and economic development of the community / country

PHC is the first level of contact of individuals, the family and community with the
national health system bringing health care as close as possible to where people live
and work, and constitutes the first element of a continuing health care process.
First contact accessibility – are services trustworthy? Are health facilities available?,
are costs prohibitive? Are competent health workers present?

PHC concept provides a new approach to health and health care, to close the gap
between the “haves” and “have-nots”, achieve more equitable distribution of health
resources, and attain a level of health for all the citizens that will permit them to lead
a socially and economically productive life.

- PHC tries to address: Magnitude of the health problems globally and Unequal
  distribution of resources
- Bringing health close to where people live and work

## Components/Elements of PHC

1. Education concerning prevailing health problems and the methods of identifying, preventing,
   and controlling them
2. Promotion of food supply and proper nutrition
3. Adequate supply of safe water, and basic sanitation
4. Maternal and child health care, including family planning
5. Immunization against the major infectious diseases
6. Prevention and control of locally endemic diseases
7. Appropriate treatment of common diseases and injuries
8. Promotion of mental health
9. Provision of essential drugs

As a country Kenya added 4 elements that included

- Dental health
- Mental health
- HIV/AIDS
- Community based rehabilitation (CBR)

## Guiding Principles of PHC

1. Equitable distribution
2. Focus on Prevention – of main health problems/major disease burden
3. Multi-sectoral collaboration /approach
4. Full community involvement and participation
5. Use of appropriate technology
6. Decentralization (decision making and service delivery, finances – Devolution)
7. Functional referral system

## Equity in PHC

Definition of Equity-WHO

Equity is the abscence of avoidable differences among groups of people defined socially economically, demographically or geographically (WHO)

- Equity means social justice or fairness; it is an ethical concept
- Equity in health can be—and has widely been—defined as the absence of socially
  unjust or unfair health disparities
- Equity is: the absence of avoidable differences among groups of people, whether
  those groups are defined socially, economically, demographically, or geographically
  (WHO)
- The absence of systematic disparities in health between social groups who have
  different levels of underlying social advantage / disadvantage (social determinants of
  health).
- Health services must be available and accessible to all irrespective of geographical
  and socio-economic status: Rich, poor, urban and rural, power,
- PHC aims to addresses the imbalance in health care by shifting the centre of focus
  from the cities (where most budget allocation is) to rural areas (where majority of
  people live)− In Kenya over 80% of the population live in rural areas
- The inverse care law is the principle that the availability of good medical or social
  care tends to vary inversely with the need of the population served
- In equitable distribution – the aim is to ensure that persons with more health needs
  receive more services− Focus is also to reduce the differences in Health Outcome
  disparities
- Individuals with different (or unequal) health should be treated differently in
  proportion to their needs: gender, socio-economic status, income, education,
  ethnicity, disability, location, nationality.

## Equity in Health care in Kenya

Health facilities are unequally distributed

- 63% of Kenyans have access to government facility located within I hr from
  their homes− In some counties like Turkana – one can even walk for 2 days
  to reach a health facility
- Health indicators and therefore below the national average: Distribution of
  health personnel falls below the WHO recommended average of 230 per
  100,000− Most staff providers are based in urban areas. Distribution of
  doctors per 10,000 people ranges from 0 (Mandera) to 2 (Nairobi) − WHO
  recommends: 1 doctor per 1000 people

## Characteristics of population(s) that experience Health Inequities

- Poor
- Marginalized populations e.g Geographical
- Racial minorities
- Ethnic minorities
- Women and children
- Persons with disabilities: physical, psychological etc—is lack of political,
  social or economic power.

### Why is there Inequity in access to PHC services?

Social Factors:

- Low education level
- Low economic status
- Living in a disadvantaged area- “hard to reach” – poor or no road
  network, no access to electricity, no access to safe /clean water
- Living rural areas or urban/informal settlements/slums −Belonging to
  ethic minority

## Community participation

This includes involving communities

## Multisectoral collaboration

Health cannot be attained by the health sector
alone. In developing countries, economic development, anti-poverty, measures, food
production, water, sanitation, housing, environmental protection and education all
contribute to health and have the same goal of human development. Primary health
care, as an integral part of the health system and of overall social and economic
development, will of necessity rest on proper coordination at all levels between the
health and all other sectors concerned.

</div>

Previous Health plans were disease based

With less focus on prevention

- The equity Life-Cycle Cohorts:
- Pregnancy and the newborn (up to 2 weeks of age)
- Early childhood (2 weeks to 5 years)
- Late childhood (6–12 years)
- Youth and adolescence (13–24 years)
- Adulthood (25–59 years)
- Elderly (60+ years)

#### Services that can be provided under PHC:

- Primary health care is the first point of contact between the community and the
  formal health system
- PHC addresses the main health problems in the community, providing promotive,
  preventive, curative and rehabilitative services accordingly.
- Services that can be provided within PHC vary from one community to another and
  between countries

At Least:

- Promotion of proper nutrition
- An adequate supply of safe water
- Basic sanitation
- Maternal and child care, including family planning
- Immunization against the major infectious diseases – eg measles, hepatitis,
- Prevention and control of locally endemic diseases - eg malaria, HIV, TB
  cholera etc
- Appropriate treatment for common diseases and injuries
- Education concerning prevailing health problems and the methods of
  preventing and controlling them
- Functional referral system
- Service and vital statistics reporting

## Evolution of PHC in Kenya

- 1964/64- Independence and Self-Rule
- 1960’s – Centralized health system, set up 250 rural health units
- 1983 – Decentralization – District focus for rural development – taking services closer to the
  people
- 1988 – Guidelines for PHC implementation . Introduction of user fees to raise funds and
  increase community participation in PHC
- 1989 – National Development Plan (1989-1993). First Mention of PHC
- 2004 – User fees reduction (10/20 policy) for PHC facilities
- 2005 – second National HSSP (2005 – 2009). Introduced the KEPH services and community
  level of health care as part of service delivery
- 2006 – first Community Health Strategy Developed. Introduction of Community Health
  Extension Workers (CHEWs) and Community Own Resource Persons (CORPs)
- 2010/12 – Devolution of Health Care – PHC transferred to Counties
- 2013 Free Maternity Services Policy. Removal of all user fees for PHC facilities

The Declaration of Alma-Ata called for "Health For All" to be attained by the year 2000-a goal that required making primary health care (PHC) the cornerstone of health systems

- implementation of PHC took a different path-especially in less advanced countries reliant on development aid-with programmes that focused on specific diseases, such as HIV, Malaria or Tuberculosis, or promoted a
  "selective" approach to PHC
- Resulted in verticalization of primary health care programmes

:::caution Question
Brainstorm. What kind of health care services can be found at the community level– individual, household
and community? Challenges encountered in implementing PHC?
:::

## Roles and Responsibilities of PHC Providers in Health and Health Care Delivery

- Level 1 Health Services; The goal of the strategy is to improve people’s health and wellbeing
  through comprehensive, participatory community programmes that effectively address the
  determinants of health
- Level 1: Community Based Approach;
- The community-based approach is the mechanism through which households and
  communities take an active role in health and health- related development issues
- It aims at building the capacity of communities to assess, analyze, plan, implement
  and manage health and health related development issues, so as to enable them to
  contribute effectively to the country’s socio- economic development.
- To empower the communities to demand their rights and seek accountability from the
  formal system for the efficiency and effectiveness of health and other services.
   Strategic Objectives of Community Strategy
- Strengthen the delivery of integrated, comprehensive and quality community health
  services for all cohorts
- Strengthen community structures and systems for effective implementation of
  community health actions and services at all levels
- Strengthen data demand and information use at all levels
- Strengthen mechanisms for resource mobilization and management for sustainable
  implementation of community health services

###### How can we strengthen delivery of Integrated and Comprehensive Quality services at the PHC / Community level?

PHC facilities are able to provide a wide range of services at that level eg

- Health education
- General curative services
- Essential investigations
- Essential medicines
- MCH
- Reproductive health services eg FP, Adolescent sexual reproductive health
  services/ Youth/Adolescent friendly services etc
- Appropriate No of staff – well trained/with up to date information
- Referral system in place

### Level 1; community level services;

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'left' }}>

</div>

### Community Health Unit

- Establishing a level 1 care unit to serve a local population of 5,000 people.
- Community-Health Volunteers (CHV), Community Health Workers
  (CHWs), Community Based Distributers (CBDs), Community Owned
  Resource Persons (CORPs) - provide level 1 services to 20 households
- Supporting every 25 Health staff with a Community Health Extension
  Worker (CHEW)
- Ensuring that the recruitment and management of community staff is
  carried out by village and facility health committees

### Staff

- **Community Health Extension Worker (CHEW)**- Health care
  provider(nurses, public health officers) employed by the health system and
  attached to a dispensary or health centre
- **Community Health Worker (CHW)**: Local member of the community gone
  through a structured training.
- **Community Own Resource Person**: also a CHW, CBDs (FP), TBAs etc

## Definition of Skilled Health Personnel

Skilled health personnel are competent maternal and newborn health (MNH) professionals
educated, trained and regulated to national and international standards. They are competent
to:

- provide and promote evidence-based, human-rights based, quality, socio- culturally
  sensitive and dignified care to women and newborns
