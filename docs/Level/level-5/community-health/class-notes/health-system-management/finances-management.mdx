## Building Blocks of Health System

Producing the expected services and results requires a strong sense of direction, and coherent investment in the various building blocks of the health system

WHO identifies the building blocks of a health system as:

- Leadership & Programme
- Health Information System
- Health Financing
- Human resources for health
- Essential medical products and technologies
- Service delivery

## Health Care Financing

###### Concept

Health financing refers to the "function of a health system concerned with the mobilization, accumulation and allocation of money to cover the health needs of the people, individually and collectively, in the health system.

Appropriate healthcare financing is a means to ensure adequate funds for health care, provide equitable access to all population groups and reduce financial barriers to utilize health services" Healthcare financing deals with generation, allocation and use of financial resources in the health system.

Health financing is a key policy instrument to improve health and reduce health inequalities.

If to facilitate universal coverage, the financing approach must:

- Remove financial barriers to access
- Prevent financial hardship and catastrophic expenditure (entrench poverty).

In order for health care organizations to succeed and provide quality healthcare for their patients, they must have financial management plans and systems that are strong and efficient.
