## Health Planning

Health planning is a scientific approach to problem solving in health economy. Examine the environment within which the health sector operates. Assess the future of the health sector within that environment. It is a logical and orderly series of steps.

Planning defines where one wants to go, how to get there and the timetable for the journey. Can identify milestones. Set out indicators for tracking progress and measure worthiness of the undertaking  Health planning is the process to produce health (needs , Resources). Nature and scope depends on time, evidence, resources, political & social environment  Health planning is a scientific approach to problem solving in health economy. Examines the environment within which the health sector operates. Assess the future of the health sector within that environment. It is a logical and orderly series of steps

### Types of health planning

Health planning includes several specific , often connected types of planning:

- Health Services – Planning for a particular type of service
- Health Systems – Planning for a system of health services
- Health Goals – identifying desirable health outcomes for the health system
- Population health – planning for the engagement of all systems to promote health

### Health planning process

- Vision and mission
- Situational analysis
- Priority settings
- Setting the goals
- Setting the objectives
- Formulate strategies
- Choose a strategy
- Plan of action
- Implementation and monitoring
- Feedback

#### Vision & Mission

Vision: Dream of the organization, Future
For instance, an efficient and high-quality health care system that is accessible, equitable and affordable for every Kenyan.

Mission: Purpose of the organization, Roadmap describes major functions & operations (who we are) Why it exists: To promote and participate in the provision of integrated and high quality promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative health care services to all Kenyans.

Values: Values serve as a baseline for actions and decision- making and guide employees in the organization's intentions and interests. The values driving behavior define the organizational culture. Values are traits or qualities having intrinsic worth, such as courage, respect, responsibility, caring, truthfulness, self-discipline, and fairness. Values serve as a baseline for actions and decision- making and guide employees in the organization's intentions and interests. A strong value system or clearly defined culture turns beliefs into standards such as best quality, best performance, most reliable, most durable, safest, fastest, best value for the money, least expensive, most prestigious, best designed or styled, easiest to use.

#### Vision, Mission & Values

What?: What goals do we actually want to accomplish?, What overall image do we wish to protect and support?, What distinguishes our products and/or services?

How?: How do we accomplish our overall goals?

Why?: Why are we trying to accomplish these overall goals?, Why will people work to achieve superior performance?

Results?: In what measurable way will our members benefit? • In what ways will the people we serve benefit?

#### Situation analysis

Adopt Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis strategies.
Comprehensive and cover these among others  
Health and environmental issues
Population characteristics/culture/SES
Organization of Health Services
Personnel and other resources o Technology as a resource & changes

#### Priority setting

Priority setting is a key phase of the planning process that aims to balance organization’s needs and resource availability. 1st do a complete listing; 2nd select using criteria

No organization has unlimited time and other resources to address all the gaps and needs. Select using criteria:

- Seriousness of problem
- Prevalence
- Feasibility of control (simple?)
- Community acceptance (Are they worried?)

#### Set goals

Strategic goals & objectives are developed to bridge the gap between current capability & the mission. They are aligned with the mission and form the basis for the action plans. Objectives are sometimes referred to as performance goals.
Criteria for determining goals: Are these:

- Relevant?
- Feasible?
- Measurable or observable?

#### Set objectives, targets

Objectives are the driver of planning processes. Are these SMART? Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Reliable / Result-Oriented, Time bound or time-limited

#### Formulate strategies

There are a variety of formal definitions for strategies, but everyone fundamentally agrees that a strategy is the answer to the question, "How?“ A strategy is _a set of actions that enable the district to achieve results._

There are three different categories of strategies:

- organizational
- programmatic
- functional

Strategy formulation is a combination of rational, scientific, intuitive best guesses. Criteria for strategy development:

- Does the strategy meet/address critical program intervention issues?
- Is this aligned with the MOH mission?
- Is this approach financially viable?
- What about access/ availablility
- Does the strategy promote integration of program interventions?
- Does it support decentralization efforts/ discourage over reliance and initiation from the centre/top?
- Does it determine how the strengths and skills can be employed to address the key issues o Based on synthesis of opportunities and strengths o Explore and consider political, social, economic, technological, legal and environmental issues

##### Choose strategies

The criteria for selecting the best strategy usually combines experience, past judgment, advice from others, & at times just a hunch. But generally: Most important, most urgent; least costly;

- most easily achieved
- acceptable to the community
- combination)
- Balance resources and needs; state the alternative strategies then select the best strategy

#### Plan of action

Before implementing the selected strategy, it is important to have a clear action plan that communicates this strategy to all stakeholders.

**Why?** To ensure planned activities are implemented; sequence, priority, time management, max. impact, enhance co-ordination, monitoring An action plan can help the supervisor stay organized, coordinate his or her team's activities

#### Implementation

Carry out activities as per the work plan. The implementation plan is a logical sequencing of activities indicating time the activities are planned to be accomplished, people responsible for those activities, resources required for the activities, monitoring indicators and means of verification.

#### Monitoring

A continuum of observation, information gathering, analysis, documentation, supervision and assessment. Monitoring progress or providing for follow-up is intended to assure that plans are carried out properly and on time.

#### Feedback

Feedback is encouraged and incorporated to determine if goals and objectives are feasible. This review is used for the next planning cycle and review.
