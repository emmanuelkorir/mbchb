## Financial Statements

Financial statements are defined as written records that illustrates the business activities and the financial performance of a company. Financial statements are audited in many cases to ensure accuracy for tax, financing, or investing purposes.

### Types of Financial Statement

- Balance sheet
- Income statement
- Statement of cash flows

1. **Balance sheet**
   Balance sheet is as statement of financial position. It is a snapshot at a point in time.

The Balance sheet has 3 main categories:

- Assets
- Liabilities and
- Equity

On the top half you have the company’s assets and on the bottom half its liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity (or Net Worth). The assets and liabilities are typically listed in order of liquidity and separated between current and non-current.

**Current assets:** Expected to be converted into cash in less than 1
year. Accounts receivable, inventory

**Current liabilities:** Will be paid in less than 1 year. Trade accounts payable.

**Noncurrent assets:**
Expected to be held greater than 1 year. Property, plant, and equipment.

**Noncurrent liabilities:**
Repayment terms longer than 1 year. Loan repayable over a 5 year.

**Intangible assets:**
Intangible assets are items of value that are used to generate revenues and have no physical substance, such as brand, customers, intellectual capital.

**Retained earnings:** Amount of profit a company has left over after paying all its direct cost, income taxes and dividends to shareholders. This represents the portion of the companys' that can be used for instance to invest in new equipment, R&D, and marketing.

**Income statement**
This is a statement of operation (profit and loss. The income statement covers a period, such as a
quarter or year. It illustrates the profitability of the company from
an accounting (accrual and matching) perspective. It starts with the revenue line and after deducting
expenses derives net income.

The Income statement has 3 main sections:

- Revenues
- Expenses
- Profit or loss

**Statement of cash flows**
It shows the cash flows of the business. The cash flow statement look at the cash position of
the company. Also, called revenue points. Statement of cash flows demonstrates:

- Where cash is being generated
- Where cash is being used in the business
  Cash flow statement answers the questions:
- How much of the organization's goes to its
  creditors and shareholders?
- Does it keep enough for its own investment and
  growth?
  Statement of cash flows has three components:
- Cash from operations
- Cash used in investments
- Cash from financing

### Objectives of Financial Reporting

- Making rational investment, credit, and similar decisions.
- The claims to those resources, and the effects of transactions, events, and circumstances that change resources/interests/bank charges and others.
- Establish an enterprise’s financial performance during a period/revenue streams.
- Describes how an enterprise obtains and spends
  cash: About its borrowing and repayment of borrowing,
  about capital transactions, and
  about other factors that may affect liquidity or
  solvency
- Describes how management of an enterprise has
  discharged its stewardship responsibility for the use
  of enterprise resources.
- Useful to managers/directors in making decisions
  in the interest of owners.
- Preparing auditing, and disseminating the
  financial reports for an enterprise to allow the
  stakeholders to determine the financial
  performance of the organization.

## Basic Accounting Concepts

- **Entity:** This concept expresses that the corporate structure, or entity, is capable of taking economic actions apart from the individuals running the entity. Accounts are kept for the business entity and reflect events that affect the business. This concept is further expanded by the "going concern” theory, which suggests that the entity will live on indefinitely, regardless of the individuals in control. This is important because it allows accountants to use a continuity assumption in valuing assets, rather than “fire sale” liquidation value at the end of each accounting period.
- **Transactions:** This simple concept requires all financial transactions that affect an organization to be included in the accounting records and reports. This is necessary to ensure that accounting data and reports are dependable and valid. If all transactions are not included, then the financial records could be inaccurate, creating the possibility that the accounting numbers are massaged or finessed undesirably and inappropriately.
- **Cost valuation:** It requires that all financial transactions be recorded at “cost,” that is, the price paid to acquire any item or good. Cost is preferable to any other valuation because it is determinable, definite, objective, and verifiable. Other valuation methods such as sale price and replacement cost are not always definite and may be a matter of conjecture or opinion. Although the cost method of valuation is not perfect, primarily because it does not properly value inflationary or deflationary trends in times of fluctuating prices, its merits outweigh the demerits.
- **Double entry:** It requires that accounting records be constructed in such a manner as to reflect two aspects of each transaction: the change in assets and the change in the source of financing (liabilities). Thus for accounting records to reflect the full effect of any transaction, two entries must be made.
- **Accrual:** This concept acts as a guide in accounting for revenues and expenses. The accrual concept requires that revenues be recorded in the accounts when they are realized and that expenses be recorded in the period in which they contribute to operations. In practice, this means, for example, that supplies purchased and used at the end of a month should be recorded as expenses for that month. But if the supply distributor has not sent out an invoice for the goods, the accrual concept requires the organization’s accountants to estimate the value of the supplies and record it in that month’s financial records. This concept permits proper allocation of income and expenses to the appropriate fiscal period.
- **Matching:** This concept requires that all associated revenues and expenses be matched in the financial records in any given month to properly determine net income. If it were not necessary to match related items, revenues, and expenses, then it would be possible to manipulate income from various types of activity to produce whatever operating picture is desired.

## Basic Financial Statements of a Health Care Organization

- Balance sheet: Presents a snapshot of the financial condition of the health care organization at a single point in time.
- Statement of operations: Presents summarized revenues and expenses of an organization, resulting in a profit or loss, for a given period of time.
- Statement of changes in unrestricted net assets: Presents a summary of financial elements that caused a change in net assets during a given period of time
- Statement of cash flows: Presents a summary of the assets and liabilities that caused a change in the main cash balances during a given period of time.
- Notes to the financial statement: Presents disclosure and discussion of the information underlying the numbers reported on the financial statements.

## Uses of Financial Information for Decision Making

- Evaluating the financial condition of an entity
- Evaluating stewardship within an entity
- Assessing the efficiency of operations
- Assessing the effectiveness of operations
- Determining the compliance of operations with directives

## Interested Stakeholders

A number of stakeholders would want to be able to make appropriate decisions about the organization using financial information:

Stakeholders of interest include the following individuals:

- For-profit equity shareholders
- Not-for-profit community board members and community members themselves
- Bondholders and their investments manager concerned about continuing solvency
- Politicians who charge governmental agencies with spending budgeted dollars

**Governing board:** The board reviews the financial performance(the bottom-line results and the level of assets and liabilities—in other words, the financial condition) as well as the organization’s actual financial ratios compared to budget and industry benchmarks. The governing board is also interested in the auditor’s review of the organization’s internal financial controls during the attestation process, sometimes called the “management letter” (stewardship).

**Senior management:** The same criteria apply here as with the governing board. In addition, senior management wants to review operating ratios such as departmental productivity (efficiency) and departmental budget variances (effectiveness).

**Department management:** Managers review the results during the period to determine their efficiency (did they make their budget numbers?) and to prepare analysis for any budget variances. Senior management should make managers accountable for their actual results compared to the budgeted goals, and consequences (both positive and negative) should be applied.

**Investment bankers, rating agencies, and bondholders:** These groups determine, on the basis of the organization’s financial condition, whether the value of any outstanding bonds has decreased or increased during the reviewed period. Millions of dollars could be at stake in the secondary market for individuals or mutual fund holders.

**Community:** Community members must determine if their resource is functioning appropriately. This may mean different things to different communities. For example, the standard in one community may mean that a not-for-profit’s board of directors prescribes that the organization should not earn a “profit” greater than 2 percent because if it does, the community may think it is “gouging” community members. Another community’s standard, however, may lead the not-for-profit organization to budget and achieve a much higher net margin.

**Benefactors:** This is a subset of the community, in as much as most organizations or individuals who give charitable donations reside in or around the community. These donors want to know whether or not their donations are being used appropriately for an organization that will remain self-sustaining (again, as reflected in its financial condition)

**Equity investors:** These are individuals and investment fund managers who are concerned with their investment and may require either stock price appreciation or dividends to maintain their participation with the stock
