# Basic healthcare financial management concepts

Dr Agot George

The financial value of any asset, whether a financial asset, such as a stock or a bond, or a real asset, such as a piece of diagnostic equipment or an ambulatory surgery center, is based on future cash flows. Because current dollars are worth more than future dollars, valuation analyses must account for cash flow timing differences.

This is because a dollar in hand today can be invested, can earn interest, and hence can be worth more than one dollar in the future. Even if no investment opportunities existed, a dollar in hand would still be worth more than a dollar to be received in the future because a dollar today can be used for immediate consumption, whereas a future dollar cannot.

## Time value analysis:

The process of assigning appropriate values to cash flows that occur at different points in time is called time value analysis. However, the application of time value analysis to valuation situations is often called discounted cash flow analysis while finding present values is called discounting. Therefore, Time value analysis is an important part of many healthcare financial management decisions because many financial analyses involve the valuation of future cash flows. Financial decisions often involve situations in which future cash flows must be valued. The process of valuing future cash flows is called time value analysis  The financial value of any asset, whether a financial asset (stock, bond, diagnostic equipment or an ambulatory surgery center), is based on cash flows. Because current dollars are worth more than future dollars, valuation analyses must account for cash flow timing differences. This is because one dollar in hand today can be invested to earn interest hence worth more than one dollar in the future. Even if no investment opportunities existed, a dollar in hand would still be worth more than a dollar to be received in the future
because a dollar today can be used for immediate consumption, whereas a future dollar cannot.

## Time lines

One important tool used in time value analysis is the time line. Time lines make it easier to visualize when the cash flows in a particular analysis occur. Times lines are used to help analysts lay out the cash flows involved in a time value analysis  To illustrate the time-line concept, consider the following five-period time line:

- Time 0 is any starting point;
- Time 1 is one period from the starting point, or the end of Period 1.
- Time 2 is two periods from the starting point, or the end of Period 2 and so on.
- Thus, the numbers on top of the tick marks represent ends of periods.

</div>

Often, the periods are years, but other time intervals—such as quarters, months, or days—are also used when needed to fit the timing of the cash flows being evaluated.  If the time periods are years, the interval from 0 to 1 would be Year 1, and the tick mark labeled 1 would represent both the end of Year 1 and the beginning of Year 2. In many time value analyses, Time 0 (the starting point) is considered to be today, although the term “today” usually does not literally mean today’s date.

Cash flows are shown on a time line directly below the tick marks, at the point in time when they are expected to occur. The interest rate that is relevant to the analysis is sometimes shown directly above the time line in the first period. In rare cases, it may be appropriate to apply more than one interest rate in a time value analysis. In this situation, interest rates may be shown in multiple periods. Additionally, unknown cash flows—the ones to be determined in the analysis—are sometimes indicated by question marks.

To illustrate a completed time line, consider the above example: Here,
the interest rate for each of the three periods is 5 percent, a lump sum
(single amount) investment of $100 is made at Time 0, and the Time 3 value
is to be determined.  The $100 is an outflow because it is shown as a
negative cash flow.

(Outflows are often designated by parentheses rather than by minus signs).

In simple analyses, it is not really necessary to designate cash flows as inflows and outflows because the analyst is well aware of the economics of the situation. However, more complicated analyses require the correct cash flow designation, and many financial calculators require that signs be attached to cash flows in all analyses, even simple ones. Time lines are essential when learning time value concepts, but even experienced analysts use time lines when dealing with complex problems.

:::caution Self Practice
Draw a three-year time line that illustrates the following situation: An investment of $10,000 at Time 0; inflows of $5,000 at the end of Years 1, 2, and 3; and an interest rate of 10 percent during the entire three years.

## Future value of lump sum (compounding)

**Compounding** is the process of going from today’s values, or present values (PVs), to future values is called compounding. Although compounding is not used extensively in healthcare financial management, it is the best starting point for learning time value concepts.

To illustrate lump sum compounding, which deals with a single starting dollar amount. Suppose that the manager of Meridian Clinic deposits $100 of the clinic’s excess cash in a bank account that pays 5 percent interest per year. How much would be in the account at the end of one year?

To begin, here are some terms used in the solution:

PV=$100=present value, or beginning amount, of the account.

I=5%=interest rate the bank pays on the account per year. The interest amount, which is paid at the end of each year, is based on the balance at the beginning of the year. Expressed as a decimal, I= 0.05.

INT=dollars of interest earned during each year, which equals the beginning amount multiplied by the interest rate. Thus, for Year 1, `INT=PV*I`

FVN =future value, or ending amount, of the account at the end of N years. Whereas PV is the value now, FVN is the value N years into the future, after the interest earned has been added to the account.

N = number of years (or periods) involved in the analysis.

To start, N = 1, so FVN is calculated as follows:

`FVN= FV1 = PV + INT= PV + (PV × I)= PV × (1 + I)`

The future value at the end of one year, FV1, equals the present value multiplied by 1.0 plus the interest rate.

This future value relationship can be used to find how much $100 will be worth at the end of one year if it is invested in an account that pays 5 percent interest:

`FV1 =PV×(1+I)=$100×(1+0.05)= $100 × 1.05 = $105`

Now, what would be the value after five years? Here is a time line that shows the amount at the end of each year:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>

</div>

Note the following points:

The account is opened with a deposit of $100. This is shown as an outflow at Year 0.

Meridian earns $100 × 0.05 = $5 of interest during the first year, so the amount in the account at the end of Year 1 is $100 + $5 = $105.

At the start of the second year, the account balance is $105. Interest of $105 × 0.05 = $5.25 is earned on the now larger amount, and the account balance at the end of the second year is $105 + $5.25 = $110.25. The Year 2 interest, $5.25, is higher than the first year’s interest, $5, because $5 × 0.05 = $0.25 in interest was earned on the first year’s interest.

This process continues, and because the beginning balance is higher in each succeeding year, the interest earned increases in each year.

The total interest earned, `$27.63`, is reflected in the final balance at the end of Year 5, `$127.63`

To better understand the mathematics of compounding, note that the Year 2 value, $110.25, is equal to:

`FV2 = FV1 × (1 + I) = PV × (1 + I) × (1 + I) = PV × (1+I)2 = $100 × (1.05)2 = $110.25`

Furthermore, the balance at the end of Year 3 is:

`FV3 = FV2 × (1 + I) = PV × (1+I)3 = $100 × (1.05)3 = $115.76`

Continuing the calculation out to the end of Year 5 gives: FV5 = $100 × (1.05)5 = $127.63. It is clear that a definite pattern exists in these future value calculations. In general, the future value of a lump sum at the end of N years can be found by applying this equation:

`FVN = PV × (1+I)n`

It is very important to understand what is commonly called “the power of compounding.” In essence, this means that a relatively small starting value can grow to a large amount over a long period of time, even when the rate of growth (interest rate) is modest.

## Present value of lump sum (discounting)

**Discounting:** Discounting is the process of finding the present value (PV) of a lump sum, an annuity, or an uneven cash flow stream. Finding present values is called discounting.

Discounting is simply the reverse of compounding:

- If the PV is known, compound to find the FV;
- If the FV is known, discount to find the PV.

To develop the discounting equation, solve the compounding equation for PV:

`Compounding: FVN = PV × (1 + I)N`

`Discounting: PV= FVN/(1 + I)N`

Illustration:  Suppose that Group West Health Plans, which has premium income reserves to invest, has the opportunity to purchase a low-risk security that will pay $127.63 at the end of five years.

A local bank is currently offering 5 percent interest on a five-year certificate of deposit (CD), and Group West's managers regard the security being offered as being as safe as the bank CD. How much would Group West be willing to pay for this security?. Answer is $100.

## Using time value analysis to measure returns on investment (ROI)

The financial attractiveness of an investment is measured by **its return on investment (ROI)**. In most investments, an individual or business spends cash today with the expectation of receiving cash in the future. The financial attractiveness of such investments is measured by return on investment (ROI), or just return. ROI can be measured either in **dollar** or **percentage terms**.
