# Concepts of Supply

## Concepts of Supply

Supply is defined as the quantity of any commodity which is offered for sale at a given moment and at any specific price

Stock is defined as the total quantity of a commodity which is available at any specific time  Supply is that part of stock which is offered for sale at any price

When price changes, supply also changes. Law of supply: Is the relationship between supply and price; other things remaining the same, when price rises, supply increases and when price falls, supply decreases. Price and quantity vary directly

A shift of supply curve to the right is referred to as an increase in supply as, at any given price, a greater quantity of product will be produced and made available for sale, referred to extended supply. A shift to the left is a decrease in supply as, at any given price, a smaller quantity will be produced and made available for sale, referred to as contracted supply

Extension and contraction of supply, and Rise and fall in supply: This is the change in supply due to change in price. Extension of supply: Occurs when supply increases due to rise in price level. Contraction of supply: Occurs when supply decreases due to fall in price level.

Assumptions of the law of supply/factors affecting supply:

- Cost of production
- Policy of the government
- Technique of production/level of technology
- Prices of related goods
- Price of inputs
- Expectations
- Transportation and communication system

Elasticity of supply: Elasticity of supply measures the response of quantity supplied to changes in any of the variables that influence it. The price elasticity of supply is defined as the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price that brought it about

### Types of elasticity of supply:

1. **Perfectly, completely or inelastic supply (zero elasticity)**
   The numerical measure of elasticity is zero. The quantity supplied does not change as price inelastic changes

2. **Perfectly, completely or infinite elastic supply**
   Sellers are prepared to sell all they can at some price and none at all at higher or lower prices. The numerical measure of elasticity is infinity

3. **Unity elasticity**
   Quantity supplied changes by exactly the same percentage as does price. The numerical measure of elasticity is one

4. **Elastic supply**
   Quantity supplied changes by a larger percentage than does price. The numerical measure of elasticity is greater than 1 but less than infinity

5. **Inelastic supply**
   Quantity supplied changes by a smaller percentage than does price. The numerical measure of elasticity is greater than zero but less than one

## Concepts of price theory

Price theory is concerned with the determination of price of any commodity. It is determined by putting demand and supply curves together. Price is determined at the level where demand for and supply of any commodity are equal referred to as equilibrium price. Equilibrium price is that price at which the quantity offered for sale equals the quantity demanded by consumers. At the equilibrium price, quantity demanded equals quantity supplied, with no shortages or surpluses.

The tendency of prices, determined by the interaction of supply and demand, to clear the market is referred to as the rationing function of prices in the sense that it automatically rations the production of the buyers leaving no shortage or surplus. The shifts in the demand or supply curves lead to a change in equilibrium price and quantity What ensures that market price prevails and that no single participant in the market can take advantage of another? In a word this depends on competition, the existence of many buyers and sellers.

## Concepts of competition

Competition is determined by the number of buyers and sellers existing in health economy. If a seller’s price is perceived a too high, buyers will seek others who are willing to sell at a lower price, thereby forcing the initial seller to lower the price or risk returning home with unsold goods/services. If a seller’s price is perceived a too high, buyers will seek others who are willing to sell at a lower price, thereby forcing the initial seller to lower the price or risk returning home with unsold goods/services. Similarly, no single buyer can force a seller to sell below market price if there are other buyers willing to pay the higher market price

### Health care market systems

- Perfect competition (considered for this class)
- Monopoly
- Oligopoly

### Characteristics of perfect competition

- Consumers pay the full price of the product. Consumers respond to differences in prices among sellers
- All firms maximize profits– Firms have incentives to satisfy consumer wants and produce efficiently
- There are many buyers and sellers, each of which is small relative to the total market– No one buyer or seller is powerful enough to influence or manipulate the market price of a product
- All firms in the same industry produce a homogeneous product. A consumer can easily find substitutes for the product of any given firm
- No barriers to entry or exit exist. New firms can enter the industry
- All economic agents possess perfect information. Consumers and firms can make informed choices
- All firms face nondecreasing average costs of production– Rules out a “natural monopoly”

## Concept of consumer choice

The determinants of consumer demand Consumer choice looks more closely at the determinants of consumer demand – Willingness to pay – Ability to pay – The demand is always at a price

### Indifference curve

Consumer choice shows how indifference curves can be used to describe consumers’ tastes and then introduce a budget line to describe the consumption possibilities open to a consumer who has a given income. A theory of demand can be built by focusing on bundles of goods between which the consumer is indifferent. Indifference curves show combinations of goods that give the same level of satisfaction. A budget constraint shows what the consumer could buy with a given
income. A consumer optimizes by moving to the highest indifference curve that is available with a given budget constraint.

### Concept of utility

Utility is the satisfaction a consumer receives from consuming products or services. Consumer choice examines the concept of utility to gain insights into how consumers allocate their spending

### Maximizing utility

Consumers will maximize their overall satisfaction when the marginal utility per pound spent is equal for all products purchased. To maximize utility consumers allocate spending between products so that equal utility is derived from the last unit of money spent on each.

Utility can be classified as:

- marginal utility
- total utility

1. **Marginal utility:** refers to the change in satisfaction resulting from consuming one unit more or one unit less of a particular product or service.
2. **Total utility:** refers to the total satisfaction derived from all the units of a product or service consumed.

#### The law of diminishing marginal utility

States that: The marginal utility generated by additional units of any product diminishes as an individual consumes more of it, holding constant the consumption of all other products.
