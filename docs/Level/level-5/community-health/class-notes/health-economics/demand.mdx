# Concepts of Demand

Dr Agot

## Definitions

**Demand** is the _quantity of a good or service which buyers are willing and able to buy at a given price in given period_ where all other conditions are constant, thus the:

- Consumers must have the ability to purchase the good or service at a price
- Consumers must be willing to purchase the goods or
  services at a price

Willingness and ability to buy goods and services determines the market demand and prices. The wants of consumers play a major role in driving the market system, a notion is referred to as “consumer sovereignty”

:::tip
Desire/want is not a demand unless one has a purchasing power. Demands are wants backed up by money. Demand is always at a price
:::

**Health need** is a state of health assessed as in need of treatment by a medical practitioner.

**The law of demand** states that demand changes **_inversely_** with the price. If the price falls, the demand increases, and if the price rises, the demand decreases.

“Other things being equal, with fall in price, the demand for the commodity is extended and with a rise in the price, the demand is contracted” (Alfred Marshall’s definition of the law of demand)

**Elements of demand:** Demand for a period is basically a relationship between price and quantity purchased during a given period.

**Demand schedule:** Is a list of different prices of a commodity and corresponding demand at theses prices

**Law of diminishing utility:** The demand curve slopes from the left to the right downwards because consumers are prepared to buy more at a lower price because of the utility of every excessive

## Determinants of demand/Assumptions of the law of demand/Constant factors of demand

1.  **Change in tastes and preferences of the individual:** There should be no change because if it changes demand will not increase despite fall in price level. This is due to advertising, changing attitudes, and lifestyles
2.  **Change in income:** There should be no change in the incomes of the consumers when price of any commodity changes. If due to rise in price level, income also increases at the same time, consumer will not decrease the demand for this commodity, so the law will not apply.
3.  **Change in substitute commodities**
4.  **Change in population**
5.  Price expectations: If further changes are expected in the price of a commodity, law of demand will not apply. People will purchase less awaiting further fall in the price level
6.  **Change in wealth**
7.  **Economic conditions**
8.  **Advertising**
9.  **Availability of credit**
10. **Invention;** Demand will not increase in new inventions of new goods
11. **Number of consumers and size of the market**
12. **Interrelated demands:** Sometimes, demand for one commodity is affected by the changes in the demand for the other commodities. Various forms of interrelated demand are:

    - **Joint /complementary demand:** Are goods needed to satisfy any want eg. Motor car and petrol; Tea leaves, sugar and milk; Books and pens

    - **Competitive/substitute demand:** Are substitute of one another e.g. tea and coffee: In this case, the demand for tea will result in decrease for coffee and vice versa
    - **Composite demand:** Are goods used for different purposes
    - **Derived demand:** Are needed to produce other goods eg. cotton for clothes.

## Extension/rise and contraction/fall of demand

According to the law of demand as the price changes, demand also changes. The changes in demand due to the changes in price are called **extensions** and **contractions of demand.**

- **Extension of demand:** An increase in demand due to fall in price
- **Contraction of demand:** Decrease in demand due to rise in price level

In extension and contraction of demand, the demand curve remains the same, but demand points shift from one place to the other place. Incase of rise and fall in demand, curve shifts from one place to another place. These two situations may be known as **change in quantity demand.**

When demand rises, the demand curve shifts from left to right upward from D1 to D2.

In the case of fall in demand, demand curve shifts from right to left downwards from D1 to D2.

**Elasticity of demand:** refers to the responsiveness of demand to a change in price. The elasticity of demand at any price or any output is the proportionate/% change in the amount purchased in response to a small change in price divided by the proportionate change in price/% change in price.

:::warning NOTE
The change in demand is not always proportionate to change in price
:::

- **Elastic demand:** Is when in certain cases, a little change in price may lead to a greater change in demand.
- **Less elastic demand:** Is when in sometimes a big change in price may bring little change in demand.
- **Inelastic demand:** Similarly, when due to any change in price, demand remains the same.
- **Infinite elastic demand:** If demand for any commodity is infinite at any price.

## Factors/determinants of elasticity of demand

- For necessities of life demand is less elastic; – are purchased whatever the price may be
- Demand for luxuries is more elastic; little change in price level brings a greater change in demand
- For substitute demand is more elastic
- Demand for goods having several uses is more elastic
- Demand for goods, the use of which can be postponed is more elastic
- Habit
- Complementary goods
- Price level

## Importance of the concept of elasticity of demand

1. **For a consumer;** normally consumers spend major portion of his/her income on the purchase of those commodities which have less elastic demand

2. **For the monopolist;** charges higher price for those commodities which have less elastic demand and vice versa

3. **Devaluation policy;** devaluation means to lower the value of domestic currency in terms of foreign currency. Due to devaluation, exports become cheaper for the foreigners and imports become expensive for the residents

4. **For the Government;** when the Government imposes taxes, elasticity factor is kept on view. The commodities which have less elastic demand, if tax is imposed on these commodities, government will get more income and vice versa

## Methods of measurement of elasticity of demand

- Unitary method
- Percentage method

1. **Unitary method:** According to Marshall, the elasticity of demand may be:
   - **Equal to unity elasticity:** is said to be equal to unity when due to change in price, the total amount spent is on any commodity remain the same.
   - **Greater than unity elasticity:** is said to be greater than unity when due to fall in price, the total amount spent on the purchase of any commodity increases or due to rise in price level, this amoun decreases.
   - **Less than unity elasticity:** is considered less than unity when the total amount spent increases with the rice in price and decrease with a fall in price.

2. **Percentage method:** According to percentage method, elasticity is measured by the help of the following formula;

**Elasticity of demand (E)** = Proportionate change in demand/proportionate change in price

:::warning NOTE
The elasticity of demand is always negative, although by convention, it is taken to be positive. Its negative because fall in price is followed by rise in demand and vice versa.

## Different concepts of elasticity of demand:

- **Price elasticity:** Is the responsiveness of demand to a change in price level. It can be measured by the help of the following formula;

Price elasticity= proportionate change in demand/proportionate change in price

Price elasticity is **always negative.**

- **Income elasticity:** Is the responsiveness of the demand to a change in income of the consumer. It is measured by dividing the proportionate change in demand by the proportionate change in income

- **Cross elasticity:** Is the ratio at which demand for any commodity changes

- **Complementary elasticity:** When consumers purchase more than one commodity then due to fall in the price of one commodity, they may purchase greater quantity of this commodity and another commodity. These two commodities may be considered complementary.

For example, when price of motor car falls, the demand for motor cars and petrol will increase. The ratio at which demand for petrol increases due to fall in price of motor cars, is
known as complementary elasticity.
