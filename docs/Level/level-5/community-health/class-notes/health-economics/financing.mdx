A function of a health system which is concerned with the mobilization, accumulation and allocation of money to cover the health needs of the people, individually and collectively within the health system (WHO, 2020).‚Äù

**Fundamental questions**

- What are the current levels of spending in developing countries?
- What is the correct level of spending?
- What are the good features of health financing system?
- Why is tax-based financing inadequate?

## Features of appropriate health financing system

The following attributes of health financing are important for performance of the health system:

- Generate sufficient revenues relative
- Pool the risks effectively
- Create appropriate incentives for providers
- Allocate resources for effective, efficient, and equitable interventions and services

## Purpose of health financing

- To make funding available in health systems
- To set the right financial incentives to providers
- To ensure that all individuals have access to effective public health and personal health care (WHO 2000).

4. Functions of health financing

## Revenue collection

All funds for health care, excluding donor contributions, are collected from the general population or subgroups within the society.

Revenue collection mechanisms/sources of revenue include:

- Taxation(general/dedicated tax)
- Subsidies
- Social insurance contributions
- Private insurance premiums
- Out of pocket payments/fee for service

## Pooling and allocation of resources

Pooling of resources is the accumulation and management of funds from individuals or households (pool members) in a way that insures individual contributors against the risk of having to pay the full cost of care out-of-pocket in the event of illness. In many cases agents of revenue collection also pool resources and purchase health care services from providers.

Resources are pooled by:

- The government through taxation, subsidies
- Social insurance through contributions
- Private insurance funds through premiums
- Health care providers through out-of-pocket payments

### Purchasing and payment of services and providers

Purchasing and payment of health services is done by public or private agencies that spend money either to provide services directly or to purchase services for their beneficiaries. In many cases, the purchaser of health services is also the agent that pools the financial resources

Purchasers and payers of health services are typically:

- The ministry of health (MOH)
- Social security agencies District health boards
- Insurance organizations
- Individuals or household through out-of- pocket payments at time of using care

## Payment mechanisms

The payment mechanisms used by health care revenue managers for each type of provider vary across countries, provinces, districts

Commonly used payment methods include:

- **Line-item budgets:** financial resources are allocated for each functional budget category, such as salaries, medicines, equipment, and administration.
- **Global budgets:** financial resources are allocated to health facilities based on type of facility, historical facility budget, number of beds, per capita rates, or utilization rates for past years
- **Capitation:** is a payment method that allocates a predetermined amount of funds per year for each person enrolled with a given provider (usually a primary care provider, such as family physician) or resident in a catchment area (in the case of hospitals). Usually there is a defined package for services covered by providers under such schemes
- **Case-based payment:** combines the estimated costs associated with all interventions typically prescribed for the treatment of a given condition and involves a set payment to providers for each patient treatment episode by condition, according to a predetermined payment schedule based on estimated total cost.
- **Per diem payment:** a predetermined payment that providers receive for each patient-day of hospital stay; the amount of the payment usually varies by type of hospital department.
- **Fee for service (user fee):** the out-of-pocket payment that patients make for each health care service at the point and time of use.

## Financing health services in Kenya

Financing health services includes:

- Insurance (3 main types: private, social, community insurance)

1. **Social health insurance (SHI):** a mandatory government-organized program that provides a (usually) specified benefit package of health services to members. Social health insurance is usually funded by payroll deductions from the employee and the employer and paid into a separate health insurance fund. Individuals can also contribute directly from their earnings
2. **Community-based health insurance (CBHI):** a voluntary program that provides (usually) a specified benefit package of health services to members who pay premiums to a community- based and communitymanaged health fund.
3. **Private health insurance (PHI):** a voluntary program of a specified benefit package of health services offered by private commercial insurance companies. Paid for by premiums (and often co-payments and deductibles) that members pay to the insurance company

- User fees
- Out of pocket expenditure
- Health savings accounts
- Dedicated tax
- Official development assistance (donations)
