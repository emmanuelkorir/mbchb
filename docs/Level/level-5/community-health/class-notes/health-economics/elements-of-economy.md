# Elements of Economics

Agot George, Ph.D.

## Scarcity of resources & opportunity cost

The discipline of economics is founded on the premise that there will never be enough resources to completely satisfy human desires. This phenomenon is referred to by economists as **scarcity.** As a result, the use of resources in one area inevitably means that they are not available for use in other areas. Thus, the benefits that would have been derived from their use in other areas are sacrificed. As individuals we are constantly making choices as to how we allocate our time, into which activities we channel our energies and on what we spend our available funds. In other words, we are making choices. Therefore, when we make a choice to spend our time on one activity or purchase a certain commodity. It means that period those funds are not available for other activities and for other purchases. As a result, the benefits that would have been derived are sacrificed. These sacrifices are referred to as **opportunity cost.** Their very existence of these phenomena provides a rationale for economists to take an interest in all resources that are used whether by: Individuals, governments, the health service or society, regardless of whether money is paid for them, in order to achieve the maximum benefit for society. Therefore, the questions of resource allocation (how societyï¿½s scarce resources are), could be or should be allocated amongst the infinite variety of competing activities, are fundamental to any study of economics. The wide range of economic systems, which have existed and evolved over time, have all attempted to address the basic economic problem of allocating resources in such a way as to maximize the benefits for society. Similarly, the varieties of approaches employed to fund and finance health care by different countries all have the same basic aim of seeking to maximize the health benefits for their citizens, given the resources they have available at that point of time. Scarcity of resources imply that each society must make important decisions
regarding the: -

1. Consumption of goods and services
2. Production of goods and services, and
3. Distribution of goods and services

Due to scarcity of resources economists are really concerned with efficiency and
equity otherwise referred to as **_the notion of efficiency and equity._** Economics is also founded on two fundamental concepts referred to as:

I. The notion of EFFICIENCY: The notion of efficiency is defined amaximizing well-being at the least cost to society. The term efficiency is used by economists to consider the extent to which decisions relating to the allocation of limited resources maximizes the benefits for society. The concept of efficiency embraces inputs (costs) and outputs and/or outcomes (benefits) and the relationship between them. Thus, a society being judged in efficiency terms by the extent to which it maximizes the benefits for its population, given the resources at its disposal. Economists are really concerned with efficiency and equity; thus, operations and performance of an economy is founded on the notion of efficiency categorized as:

1. Allocative efficiency
2. Productive efficiency
3. Distributive efficiency (equity)

### Allocative efficiency

- **Question:** What is the best way to allocate resources to different consumption uses?
- First; allocative efficiency in the overall economy and the health economy is achieved when the best mix of goods and services; both medical and non-medical are chosen given societies underlying individual and societal preferences in the macroeconomy
- Secondly; allocative efficiency is achieved when the best mix of medical goods and services are chosen given the societies underlying individual and societal preferences in the health economy

### Production efficiency/technical efficiency

- Production efficiency implies that society is getting the maximum output from its limited resources because the best mix of inputs has been chosen to produce each good often referred to as efficiency savings
- It is expected in productive/technical efficiency that output should be maintained, while at the same time making cost reductions or additional output is generated with the same level of inputs.
- Productive/technical efficiency is applied where a choice needs to be made between alternatives that seek to achieve the same goal. Productive/technical efficiency exists when output is maximized for a given cost, or where the costs of producing a given output are minimized. Productive/technical efficiency is widely used in the context where for example, new therapies are compared against existing treatments, and authorities must decide whether it is worth paying more for the potential additional benefits that the new therapy offers. Productive/technical efficiency may also be known as operational efficiency/cost- effectiveness
- The law of diminishing marginal returns; this is a theory in economics that predicts that after some optimal level of production capacity is reached, adding an additional factor of production results in smaller increases in
  outputs.
- Distributive efficiency/equity. The notion of equity is inextricably linked with notions of fairness and justice. However, it is important to distinguish the notion of equity from the concept of equality, which is the condition of being equal.
- **Health inequity:** Inequity refers to unfair and avoidable inequalities that are not inevitable or natural but the product of human behavior.
- **Health inequality:** Inequality, on the other hand, simply refers to the uneven distribution of resources
- **Health disparity:** A disparity simply means a difference. It does not specifically refer to differences that are the result of unfairness or injustice.

Distributive efficiency/equity asks whether the distribution of services is equitable, or fair, to everyone involved. Theoretical foundations underpinning question of distribution/equity include: **The pure market system and A perfect egalitarian system**

### Pure market system

The goods and services are distributed, or rationed, to only those people who are both willing and able to purchase them in the marketplace. Productive resources/factors of production (labor, capital, technology) tend to be allocated efficiently in pure market system in the macroeconomy. However, pure market system is typically viewed as inherently unfair by many when it comes to the distribution of important goods and services such as health care. Given income disparities, some people may be denied access to needed goods and services

### An egalitarian system

In an egalitarian system, everyone has access to the same goods and services without regard to income status or willingness to pay.

- Informs the concept of Universal Health Coverage
- Also informs the concepts of National Social Health Insurance Fund (NSHIF)
  No one is denied access to needed goods and services

### The Notion of Equity

The notion of equity is inextricably linked with notions of fairness and justice, but it is important to distinguish the notion of equity from the concept of equality, which is the condition of being equal.

The two broad branches of economics are:

## Microeconomics

Microeconomics is a branch of economics that studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding allocation of scarce resources and the interactions among the individuals and firms. It entails production at the level of the firm and consumption at the level of the individual and household. Consumer choices and rational decision in maximizing their utility under constraint budget.

## Macroeconomics

Macroeconomics is a branch of economics concerned with the economy as a whole studying aggregate phenomena. distinctly considers activities that directly relate to population health consisting of:

- Production (factors of production include labor, capital, and technology)
- Consumption
- Distribution
  It is a branch of economics concerned with the economy as a whole studying aggregate phenomena, such as: Business cycles, Living standards, Inflation, Unemployment, and The balance of payments. Macroeconomics deals with economic issues affecting the whole economy as an analytical unit. Macroeconomics also asks how governments can use their monetary and fiscal policy instruments to help stabilize the economy. Macroeconomics is useful because it enables us to study events that affect the economy as a whole without getting into too much detail about specific products and sectors.

## Macroeconomics/Economic Indicators

The performance of macroeconomy is assessed by considering the following economic indicators: -

- Unemployment
- Inflation, and
- Gross domestic product growth rates

### Health economy/health economy indicators

The indicators for health economy is assessed by the following performance
indicators: -

- Costs of medical services
- Access to medical services, and
- Quality of medical services

Macroeconomics entails how **_Gross Domestic Product (GNP), Gross National Product (GNP), Gross National Income (GNI), Income Per Capita_** among others aggregates are accumulated, assessed, measured and used.

## Gross Domestic Product (GDP):

GDP can be measured as the sum of value added by all producers, as the sum of income claims generated in producing goods and services, or as the spending on all final goods and services produced. GDP measures the value of what is produced in this country. GDP is one of the best measures available of the total economic activity within a country. It is particularly valuable when changes in GDP are used to indicate how economic activity has changed over time.

## National product

National product is the value of all goods and services produced in the nation

## National income

National income is the total income created by producing the national product

## Public good and role of government

Public good is a commodity or service that is provided without profit to all members of a society, either by government or by private individual, or organization. Examples are roads, health facilities

## Investment

Investment is the production of capital goods, its production of physical goods e.g. structures, equipment

## Public finance

Public finance is a branch of economics that assess the government revenue and government expenditure of public authorities and the adjustments of one or more other to achieve desirable effects and avoid undesirable ones. Example; public finance management act, public procurement and disposal act among others

## International aid

International aid also referred to as foreign aid is the foreign transfer of capital, goods or services from a country or international organization for the benefit of
recipient country or its population. It can be economic, military, or emergency humanitarian

## International trade

This is the exchange of goods and services between countries

Welfare economics is an economic theory that examines the costs and benefits of alternative health interventions (referred to as **cost benefit analysis**). It measures both costs and benefits of the alternative interventions. It determines the alternative intervention with the maximum benefit to the society at the least cost. Some of the economic techniques used to estimate societal economic welfare are:

1. Willingness to pay (WTP)
2. Willingness to accept (WTA)
