# Questionnaire Design

Ms Kellen Karimi

### Data

What is data?

The types of data (Primary Vs Secondary)
Primary data: From the source (quantitative or qualitative)
Secondary: Data gathered by an individual who is not the original user- already existing

Choice of type of data is determined by nature, scope, area of research and aims and objectives

## Importance of collecting data

- Intergrity of research
- Reduce likelihood of errors
- Decision making
- Save cost and fime
- Support a need for a new idea, change and/or innovation

## Data Collection tool

- Device or instrument used to collect data e.g.
- Questionnaire/survey
- Checklists
- Computer assisted systems

## What is a questionaire?

Is the process of collecting data through an instrument consisting of a series of questions and prompts

Aim is to receive response/ gather data from respondents about attitudes. experiences or opinions

Can be used to collect quantitative and/or qualitative information

It's very important part of the research process

## Questionnaire design

This means creating valid and reliable questions that address research objectives, placing them in a useful order and selecting an appropriate method of administration

Design is only one component of the research process

Research also involve other process like defining the population, sampling method, administration of the questionnaire, data cleaning and analysis and interpretation

Qualities of a good questionnaire

- Proper length
- Easy and simple language
- Terms used must be properly explained
- Question should be arranged in proper way
- Questions should be in a logical manner
- Questions should be in analytical form

Steps in questionnare design

1. Decide information required
2. List the questions to be included
3. Refine the phrasing of the questions
4. Develop the response format
5. Order the questions in a logical sequence
6. Develop the questionnaire layout
7. Pre-test the questionnaire and revise

### Step 1: Decide the required information

- This is the starting point
- A proposal is developed with a list of objectives
- Based on the objectives, the information required is extracted
- The order of how the objectives are achieved

### Step 2: List the questions to be included

- A rough list of the questions likely to go into the questionnare
- This ensures comprehensiveness in the listing
- Ensures no likely question is left out
- No worries about the phrasing at this point

### Step 3: Refine the phrasing of the questions

- Questions must make sense
- Must be able to generate the desired values
- Good questions must not have more than one question
- Must be precise

### Step 4: Develop a response format

- Each question needs a response
- The list of answers could be pre-coded or open ended to collect verbatim comments from respondents
  Considering the answers helps one get the question right

### Step 5: Order the questions in a logical sequence

- Bring out logic and flow to the interview
- The respondent is at ease when the more straightforward, easy questions are asked before the more difficult and sensitive ones
- This helps the interviewer not to prompt the respondents
- It could introduce bias in the process

### Step 6: Develop the questionnaire layout

- Format the questionnaire
- Add clear instructions to the interviewer (Introduction, routings and probes)
- Provide enough space to write the responses
- Separate the codes clearly from each other so that the interviewer doesn't accidentally circle the wrong response

### Step 7: Pre-test and revise

This is the final step

- Pilot at least among 10 respondents to make sure the questionnaire works (use the method that will be used in the actual data collection- e.g. if over the phone, self administered or interviewee administered)
- If time and money does not allow, the questionnare can be tested among colleagues for sense, flow and clarity of instructions
- Piloting checks if changes are needed so that revisions are made

### Questionnaire methods

- Sef-administered
- Researcher administered

#### 1. Self administered

This can be either;

- On-line
- Paper-and-pen formats
- In-person
- Through mail

##### Advantages

- Cost-effective
- Easy to administerfor small and large groups
- Anonymous and suitable for sensitive topics
- Self paced

##### Disadvantages

- Unsuitable with people with limited literacy levels
- Susceptible to non-response bias
  Biased towards people who volunteer

#### 2. Researcher administered

- This can either be
- By phone
- In-person
- Online

###### Advantages

- Helps ensure respondents are representative of targel audience
- Alloy clarifications of ambiguous or unclear questions and answers
- Have high response rate

##### Disadvantages

- Costly and time consuming to perform
- More difficult to analyze if responses are qualitative
- Likely to contain experimant bias
- Likely to encourage social desirability bias in responses because of lack of anonymity

## Types of Questions in Questionnaire

1. Closed ended
2. - Open ended

### 1. Closed-ended

- These are restricted -choice questions
- Offers a fixed set of choices to select from
- They are bet for collecting data on quantitative variables
- Its important to understand the type of variable and the level of measurement
- Statistical analyses are performed for generalizable results

#### Examples of closed ended questions

###### Nominal variables

Ranked categories and binary/dichotomous categories

What's your level of education?

- Below primary
- Primory
- Secondary
- Tertiary

Are you satisfied with the current work-from-home policies?

- Yes
- No

###### Ordinal variables

Categories that can be ranked- consider the range to include

What is your age

- 15 and younger
- 16-35
- 36-60
- 61-75
- 76 or over

###### Likert type questions

How satisfied or dissatisfied are you with you online shopping experience today?

- Very dissatisfied
- Somewhat dissatisfied
- Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied
- Somewhat satisfied
- Very satisfied

## Pros and cons of closed ended questions

### Pros

- Well designed questions are easy to understand
- Answered quickly

### Cons

- Important answers can be missed that are relevant
- Incomplete set of response items may force some respondents to pick the closest alternative to their true answer
- May miss out on valuable details
- This can be solved by including an open ended question where the respondent can write own answer

## 2. Open- ended questions

- Are long form questions
- Questions allow respondents to give their own answers in their own words
- No restrictions on their choices
- Respondents answer in ways the researcher may have not considered

#### Example of Open-ended questions

1. How do you feel about community health?
2. How do you describe your personality?
3. In your opinion, what is the biggest obstacle for children immunization in community X?

### Disadvantages of Open ended questions

- Require more time and effort from respondents, this may deter them from completing the questionnaire
- Time and resources are required for the researcher to comprehend and summarize the responses

## Question wording

Influences respondents' answer if language is unclear, ambiguous or biased

Good questions must be understood by all respondents in the same way (reliable) and measure exactly what the researcher is interested in (valid)

## Considerations in question wording

Use clear language

Have the target audience in mind

Avoid jargon and use complete language for readability and clarity

Use balanced framing

Respondents answer in different ways depending on how the question was framed

Positive frames are more neutral than negative frames and may encourage more socially desirable answers

Example of positive Vs Negative frame

Should protests of pandemic-related restrictions be allowed?

Should protests of pandemic-related restrictions be forbidden?

Balanced use of both negative and positive frame is good to avoid bias

Example of balance Vs unbalanced frames

Do you favor....? /Do you favor or oppose.....?

Do you agree that.....?/ Do you agree or disagree that.....?

Avoid leading questions

Leading questions guide respondents towards answering questions in a specific way even if that's not how they truly feel, by providing them with extra information

Keep questions short and specific to your topic of interest

Example of leading question

The average daily work commute in Nairobi takes 2 hours and costs Sh. 300. Since 2020, working from home has saved many employees time and money. Do you favor flexible work-from-home policies even after it's safe to return to offices?

Keep your questions focused

Ask about one idea at a time to avoid confusing the respondent

Example of double barreled question

Do you agree or disagree that the government should be responsible for providing clean drinking water and high internet to everyone?

## Question order

a. Organize questions logically with clear progression from simple to complex

b. Can also randomize question order between respondents

### Logical flow

Simple questions like behavioral or opinion questions to complex, sensitive or controversial questions

Danger with this some question orders can affect responses by priming
them in specific directions

Order of questions effects occur when earlier questions influence responses to later questions, reducing validity of questionnaire

Demographic characteristics are not affected by order, but opinions and attitudes are more susceptible
Minimizing order effect minimizes systematic error

### Randomization

Involves presenting individual respondents with same questionnaire but with different order

It may however make it harder for respondents to process the questionnaire

Some questions need more cognitive effort, while others are easier to answer

A random order require more time or mental capacity for respondents to switch between questions
