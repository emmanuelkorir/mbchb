## Formulation of Research Objectives

What is the motivation for research?

The essence of all research originates from curiosity

Driven by the desire to find out how and why things happen.

Thus, researcher seeks to answer the questions:

- Why is...?,
- How can we intervene...?
- What is the best way to...
- What causes...?
- What are the effects..?

###### Significance of research/why do research?

- Initiates scientific and inductive/deductive (original) thinking
- Promotes logical habits of thinking and organization
- Inform government policies
- Helps in professional improvement

## Statement of the problem

- Statement of the problem identifies the nature of the problem
- The gaps/problems existing
- Why do those gaps/problems exist
- Gap identified informs the goal of the study

## Goals of a study

Goal is general and stated as the solution of the problem identified

Objectives are derived from the goal/broad objective of the study

Objectives must have same intentions as the study goal

The general objective of a study states what researchers expect to achieve by the study in general terms.

It is possible (and advisable) to break down a general objective into smaller. logically connected parts

**"An achievable study objective"**

Able to: -

- Attain the objectives of the study
- Know and provide the resources required
- Know and provide required capacities

**"A realistic study objective"**

Able to: -

- Obtain the level of change reflected in the objective

**"A time-bound study objective"**

States the time period in which they will each be accomplished

### Specific research objectives

Specific objectives should specify

- What you will do in your study?
- Where you conduct your study, and for?
- What purpose?

### Example: problem, what, why, where? questions

Out of curiosity, a researcher interested in health care systems is concerned about the costs and quality of health care of home-based care for HIV/AIDs in his/her community.

Three variables of interest from this statement of the problem are;

- Quality of home-based care (dependent variable)
- Cost (independent variable) of care
- How does costs (independent variable) affect quality of home-based care (dependent variable)

The interest of this researcher could further explore the extent community home. based care (CHBC) as quality indicators of the service such as:

- Adequacy of the services
- Affordability of the services, and
- Sustainability of the services

All these concerns are aimed at addressing the quality of home-based care for HIV/AIDs patients in the community

## Title of the study

Now you can draw the title of your study. The title should be in line with your general objective. Make sure that it is specific enough to tell the reader what your study is about and where it will be conducted

Example of the study title:

- Example of the study title from the above problem of the statement: -
  "A study on cost and quality of community home-based care for HIV/AIDS patients in community A in 2021"
  OR
- "Factors affecting the quality of home-based care to HIV/AIDs patients in community A in 2021"

#### Objective of the study

A general objective derived from this problem of the statement could be:
"To determine the factors affecting the quality of home-based care to HIV/AIDs patients in community A in 2021"

This objective is focused on identifying ways in which the community-based health services to HIV/AIDs patients can be improved

The important elements to consider in this broad objective are: -

- Person (who?); HIV/AIDS patients
- Place (where?); community A, and
- Time (when?); 2021

Others elements include (what?); factors

These elements should be considered in every study objective, both broad and specific as well as the research questions

#### Specific objectives

Specific objectives and corresponding research questions drawn from the above general objective and following specific objectives: -

1. To estimate the full range of economic costs of home-based care to HIV/AIDS patients
   What are the directs costs of community-based HIV/AIDs care to patients?
   What are the indirect costs of indirect costs of HIV/AIDs care to patients?
2. To determine the extent to which support systems address the patients' health needs
   What are the formal support systems for HIV/AIDs patients in the community?
   What are the informal support systems for HIV/AIDs patients in the community?
3. To identify health needs of HIV/AIDs patients in the community
   What are the medical needs of HIV/AIDs patients in the community
   What are the nursing needs of HIV/AIDs patients in the community
   What are the psychological needs of HIV/AIDs patients in the community

Note: Take note that research questions can as we be stated as research broad/specific obiective

The first specific objective usually focuses on quantifying or specifying the problem. This is necessary in many studies, especially when a problem has been defined (but not quantified) for which subsequently the major causes must be identified. Often use can be made of available statistics or of the health information system

For example, the burden certain diseases such as the NCDs/TB. Why what, who, where questions. To identify
contributing factors to defaulting be analyzed; high defaulter rate of TB patients should first be established using the records.

Why should research objectives/questions be developed? The formulation of objectives will help you to:-

- Focus the study (narrowing it down to essentials)
- Avoid the collection of data which are not strictly necessary for understanding and solving the problem you have identified; and
- Organize the study in clearly defined parts or phases.

Properly formulated, specific objectives: -

- Facilitate the development of research methodology and
- Help to orient the collection, analysis, interpretation and utilization of data.

Examples of action verbs are:

- To determine: find out a relationship can be case control (results include odds ratio) or cohort (results include risk ratio)
- To compare
- To verify
- To calculate
- To describe: use absolute no. 20% of population suffer from Malaria
- To establish

:::caution NOTE
Avoid the use of vague non-action verbs such as:-
To appreciate, To understand, or To study. Keep in mind that when the project is evaluated, the results will be compared to the objectives. If the objectives have not been spelled out clearly, the project cannot be evaluated.

## Hypotheses

Based on your experience with the study problem, it might be possible to develop explanations for the problem, which can then be tested.

If so, you can formulate hypotheses in addition to the study objectives.

A hypothesis is a prediction of a relationship between one or more factors and the problem under study that can be tested.

It can be null or alternate hypothesis
