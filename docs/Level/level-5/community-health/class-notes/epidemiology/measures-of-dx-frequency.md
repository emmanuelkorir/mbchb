# Measures of Disease Frequency

Dr Chesang

## Important Definitions

- Count: enumeration of GE number of cases of disease or number of persons affected with a condition in a given population. Often doesn’t include population size hence are of limited use
- Ratio: one number divided by another number
- Proportion: a special type of ratio in which everything or very one in the numerator is also counted in the denominator. Values ranges from 0 to 1 (0-100%). `All proportion are ratios, not all ratios are proportions`.
- Odds: the ratio of the probability of the event of interest to that of the non event
- Rate: division of two numbers, time is always in the denominator

## Incidence

Indicates proportion of newly developed (incident) causes of a disease. Expresses frequency of a new event.

Variously reported as:

- Count (1.5M)
- Proportion (0.02%)
- Rate (650 new cases per 100,000 people per year). Mostly preferred

Includes: **cumulative incidence (CI)** and **incidence rate (IR)**

### Uses of Incidence

- Research on causes, prevention and treatment of disease

**Cumulative incidence:** the proportion of people at risk who develop disease during a
specific period.

`CI= No of people who develop disease in a specific period ÷ number of people at risk of getting the disease at the start of the period`

Synonyms: attack rate (infectious diseases), case fatality rate (ratio)

Units:
-%
-proportion (or per 1,000, 10,000, 100,000 etc)

Can calculate CI only in clearly defined group with complete follow up: if not we use **incidence rate**

Incidence Rate: measures how quickly people are developing a disease. Not a proportion. Units is 1/time

Based on:

- aggregate data
- individual data

Routine rates are based on population averages.

**The ‘mid-interval’ population:** the average of the size of the population at the start and at the end of the period of interest or estimated from census data. The rate at which disease is occurring, measured from population data, May be `crude specific (eg age specific)` or `standardized (direct standardization)`

`IR= ( No of people who develop disease in one year ÷ average number in the population in the same year)`

Units: per 100,000/year (or per 1000, 10,000/year etc)

Epidemiological rates: sum of individual person-time. The rate which disease is occurring, measured from individual data in a study

```
IR = ( No of people who develop disease in a specified period ) ÷
( No of person-time when people were at risk of getting the disease )

```

Synonym: incidence density

Units: per 100,000/person-years (or per 1,000, 10,000 person years etc)

A mortality rate is an incidence rate in which the event being measured is death.

| Incidence Rate                    | Cumulative Incidence                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Easier to interpret               | `CI = IR x Time`                                                         |
| Speed, an instantenous measure    | Distance, a cumulative measure(function of IR & the length of follow-up) |
| Smallest value is 0               | Smallest value is 0                                                      |
| Greatest value is ∞               | Greatest value is 1                                                      |
| Units is                          | Units is none                                                            |
| Interpretation is inverse of time | Interpretation is probability                                            |

## Prevalence

A measure of disease status: either present or absent

The prevalence proportion is the proportion of people in a population who have
disease at a specific point in time

`Prevalence time= No of people with disease at a given point in time ÷ total number of people in the population`

No units, reported as:

- A proportion or a percentage
  - 2.9% of sub Saharan Africans had HIV AIDS at end of 2007
- Cases/population
  - 390/100,000 North Americans has HIV AIDS at the end of 2007

**Point prevalence:** Cases at a given point in time. The time point at which people are counted should always be reported: fixed point in calendar time or life

**Period prevalence:** Cases during a given period. Measures the proportion of the population that had the disease at any time during a specific period. Includes existing and new cases

**Cumulative (lifetime) prevalence:** Cases at any time in the past (up to present time). A period prevalence

### Relationship with Incidence

- Incidence: frequency of a new event
- Prevalence: frequency of an existing event
- Prevalence is affected by: IR, average duration of disease
- When the prevalence is low (<10%), the relationship can be expressed as:
  - Prevalence = incidence x duration},
  - otherwise (P ÷ (1-P)) = incidence rate x time

### Uses of Prevalence

- Health policy and planning: describes the overall disease burden of a population.
- Also reflects burden in terms of life expectancy, morbidity, quality of life, or other indicators.
- A good measure of underlying forces driving the occurrence of disease such as birth defects and birth related phenomena such as birth weight or preterm birth.
- Useful parameter for diseases that have insidious (gradual) onset and long duration (DM, MS,OA); difficult to define onset

### Limitations of Prevalence

- Not commonly used in causal research. Not ideal measure for studying etiology.
- Not ideal for disorders and conditions with a relatively low population prevalence or base rate.
- Not useful for diseases with short duration such as chickenpox.

## Common measures of Disease Frequency

Many are fundamental to health planning and service provision. Expressed as: ratios, percentages, per 100, 1,000, 10,000 or 100,000 population.

Always check: what numbers are being compared, what the size of the reference population.

- **Crude mortality rate(CMR):** total number of deaths from all causes per 100,000 population per year.

  > CMR= total deaths ÷ total population

- **Cause specific mortality rate:** number of deaths from a specific cause per
  100,000 population per year

- **Age specific mortality rate:** total number deaths from all causes among individuals in a specific age category per 100,000 population per year in the category

- **Age standardized incidence and mortality rates:**

  - **Direct standardization:** involves calculating the overall incidence or mortality rate that you would have expected to find in a standard population if it has the same age specific rates as your study population.

  - Standardised mortality rate = Expected deaths ÷ standard population

- **Standardized Incidence and Mortality Ratios (SIR/SMR):**

  - **Indirect standardization:** observed deaths ÷ expected deaths.
  - Compare groups (observed number of deaths divided by expected number). A measure of association.

- **Attack rate:** number of new cases per population at risk. It is a cumulative inicidence. Can be used in infectious disease outbreaks.

- **Case fatality rate:** the proportion of people with a given disease or condition who die from it in a given period. It is a cumulative inicidence.

- **Survival rate:** the proportion of patients who are still alive a specified number of years after diagnosis. It is a cumulative inicidence and a complement of CFR. A relative survival rate; adjusted for expected deaths from other cause

- **Morbidity rate:** number of existing or new cases of a particular disease or
  condition per 100 population.

- **Live birth rate:** total number of live births per 1000 population per year. Sometimes the denominator includes only women of reproductive age.

- **Maternal mortality rate:** deaths from cause related to pregnancy and childbirth in 1 year ÷ number of live births in the same year.

- **Perinatal mortality rate:** Foetal death (>28 weeks) and deaths up to 7 days of live births + Foetal deaths in the same year.
- **Neonatal mortality rate:** deaths in children ages less than 28 days ÷ number of live births in the same year.
- **Infant mortality rate:** deaths in children up to 1 year of age ÷ number of live births in the same year.

- **Under 5 mortality rate:** deaths in children up to 5 years of age ÷ number of live births in the same year.

- **Life expectancy:** a statistical measure of the average time an organism is expected to live, assuming the current mortality rate remains constant.

- **Years of potential life lost (YPLL) or potential years of life lost (PYLL):** an estimate of the average years a person would have lived if they had not died prematurely. It is, therefore, a measure of premature mortality.

- **Disability-free life expectancy:** the average number of years an individual is expected to live free of disability if current patterns of age-specific mortality and disability continue to apply.

- **Quality-adjusted life year:** a generic measure of disease burden, i.e. how much longer a person would have lived given that a proper medical intervention was done. It is used in economic evaluation to assess the value of medical interventions.

- **Health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE):** the number of years in full health that an individual can expect to live given the current morbidity and mortality conditions.
- **Disability-adjusted life year (DALY):** a measure of overall disease burden, expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death, given that the current patterns of age-specific mortality and disability continue to apply.
