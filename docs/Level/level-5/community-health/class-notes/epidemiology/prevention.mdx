# Prevention

Dr Chesang

It is preferable that people do not actually get sick

**Epidemiology**

- Identify modifiable causes
- Relative and absolute measures which guide preventive action
- Evaluation of preventative measures in action

**Natural History of disease:** the course of a disease from its inception to its resolution

- Induction period
- Latent period (Preclinical stage)
- Clinical stage

**Critical point:** after which the disease process is irreversible and treatment will confer
little or no benefit eg. cancer metastasis. Beneficial if it occurs between the time of first possible detection and the usual time of diagnosis. Screening not helpful if the CP occurs before disease detection possible or time of usual clinical diagnosis.

## Levels of prevention

- **Primordial:** risk factor reduction targeted towards an entire population through a focus on social and environmental conditions. Such measures typically get promoted through laws and national policy.
- **Primary prevention:** lower disease incidence limit the clinical burden. Aimed at a susceptible population or individual. The purpose of primary prevention is to prevent a disease from ever occurring. Thus, its target population is healthy individuals.
- **Secondary:** screening to identify diseases in the earliest
- **Tertiary:** managing disease post diagnosis to slow or stop complications
- **Quaternary:** an action taken to protect individuals (persons/patients) from medical interventions that are likely to cause more harm than good.
- Others can lead to larger increase in clinical activity

## Strategies for prevention

1. **High risk strategy**
   A targeted rescue operation for vulnerable individuals. How? Preventing/reducing the level of exposure or protection against the consequences of the exposure

**Advantages:**

- More acceptable in the medical care practice
- Intervention is well matched to the individual and their concerns and thus should also improve the benefit to risk and benefit to cost ratios

2. **The mass/population strategy**
   Aims to reduce the health risk of entire population

**Advantages:**

- Can address upstream causes
- Addresses context

**Limitation:**

- Difficulties of effective implementation
- Benefit to community but not much to individual

3. **Middle road strategy**

## PAF a guide to prevention

The PAF also represents the _maximum percentage reduction in the burden of disease (or death) that might be expected if we could remove the exposure completely._

:::tip NOTE
Often adds upto > 100%. Addressing the causal with the greater PAF proportion would reduce the burden of the disease.

<details>
<summary>Rothman's Causality Model</summary>

Causal pie or sufficient-component cause model. Each pie represents a theoretical causal mechanism for a given disease(a sufficient cause). A is a necessary cause. A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H I, and J are component cause.
Classification of Causes

- A sufficient cause - a factor(s) that will inevitably produces disease. A complete causal mechanism that inevitably produces disease. A sufficient cause is not a single factor a minimal set of factors that unavoidably produce disease. A disease can originate from several different sufficient causes.
- A component cause - a factor that contributes towards disease causation but is not sufficient to cause a disease on its own. A single component cause or subset of component causes does not result in disease. Component causes need not to be similar. Absence of a protective or presence of an harmful factor.
- A necessary cause - a factor (or component cause) that is required for the development of a given disease. Most component causes are neither necessary nor sufficient causes of a disease.

**Weaknesses**

- Assumes that exposure is dichotomous. A cut off is needed.
- Determining the reference group

**Attributable burden of disease due to a risk factor:** the amount of disease due to levels of exposure above the defined reference level.

**Attributable fraction** is the proportion of that disease which can be attributed to the risk factor

To gain maximum future benefit from a preventative intervention we would have to reduce exposure to their reference level; not always possible

## Attributable and avoidable disease

- Attributable burden
- Avoidable burden

The burden of the disease not attributable to the risk factor of interest may be decreasing, constant or increasing over time.
