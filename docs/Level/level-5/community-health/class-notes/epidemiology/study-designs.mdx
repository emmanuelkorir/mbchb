# Study Designs

Dr Chesang

## Definitions

Study design: the methodology that is used to collect the information to address the research
question. To harvest valid and precise information.

Validity: lack of bias and confounding.

## Types of study designs

1. Descriptive studies (answers the question what, who, when):

- Case series and case reports)
- Prevalence survey
- Migrant studies, ecological or correlation studies

2. Analytic studies (answers the question why)

- Observational studies: cohort studies, case control, ecological, cross sectional
- Intervention studies: Randomized (RCTs), non randomized

## Descriptive studies

Concerned with person, place and time. Answers the questions: **WHO? WHAT? WHEN? WHERE?**

**Uses:**

- Can provide the first idea about causality
- Assessing the health status of population
- Planning and evaluating public health programmes (gives you numbers)
- Identify a disease clusters and disease epidemic

1. Case reports and case series

Detailed descriptions of one of more cases of a disease that are unusual for some reason. Can be a new disease, previously unaffected individuals, new areas, previously controlled

Advantages:

- May stimulate interest in an area leading to more detailed studies.
- Can help identify health problems eg acute outbreaks

Limitations:

- Little evidence of causality. Does not describe pattern of disease occurrence

2. Prevalence Surveys

Determines prevalence of a factor of interest in the community (do cross sectional studies first using representative samples). Can be called **descriptive cross-sectional study.**

Cross sectional studies: relations between two aspects of health in a cross section of the population

3. Migrant Studies

Separates the effects of nature and nurture eg prevalence of diabetes in a certain area is the cause genetic? Environmental? (Observational: you don’t inform a group to migrate but follow up to compare)

## Analytic studies

Planned comparisons between people with and without disease/exposure (in analytic studies _all other factors should be same in interest population except for exposure/outcome of interest_) eg compare those that smoke and non smokers: who has PUD, OR those with PUD and those that don’t: how many are smokers and non
smokers

Answers the questions: **why** do some people develop disease, **how** strong is the association between exposure and outcome **(strength of association).**

Are main tools for identifying the causes of disease and evaluating health interventions.

Classified into:

- Experimental (investigator actively manipulated which groups receive the agent under study eg a vaccine)
- Observational (investigator passively observes as nature takes its course)

1. Experimental Studies

Also known as **intervention studies.** Earliest: **James Lind:** Scurvy: 1747. The investigator actively intervenes to change something to see what effect this has on disease occurrence. Includes treatment/clinical trials and preventive trials eg folic acid in preventing NTD.

Treatment group: Allocated the agent under the study. Comparison group: not allocated the agent under study eg a drug

**Random allocation/randomization:** ensures that all of the ground are as similar as possible at the start of the study. Randomized studies are considered the **gold standard** of study design as they minimize bias and confounding. Note the difference between randomization and random selection. Placebo: Pharmacologically inactive substance.

:::tip NOTE
State of equipoise must exist for the study to be ethical (if it’s clear a drug is beneficial or harmful: no reason to withhold beneficial agent or continue the harm eg HRT).
:::

Eligibility criteria: has to be scientific, safety, ethical and practical concerns: this criteria influences generalizability. Allocation can be random or non random. Length of follow up is dependent on outcome of interest eg longer for a chronic disease. Minimize losses to follow up and drop outs eg using population of motivated individuals eg HCW or simply study without compromising it. Assessment of compliance: non compliance makes it difficult to determine if an experimental treatment is effective.

**Blinding (masking)**

- **Single blind:** only participant is unaware of their allocation.
- **Double blind:** both investigator and the participant are unaware of allocation.
- **Triple masked:** the participants, the investigators administering the treatment and investigator monitoring the effects of the treatment are masked.

Importance of blinding: knowledge of treatment may affect both the participant’s response and an observer’s measurement of outcome.

2. Crossover trials vs parallel study (one group takes drug vs other doesn’t)
   In cross over study _a participant serve as their own control_ eg take analgesics only when symptomatic, **parallel study.** Needs fewer participant. Not all interventions can be studied in this manner.

**N of 1 trials:** variant of crossover trial (uses only 1 participant)

Disadvantages of experimental studies

- High costs (eg follow up, investigations)
- Ethical issues, physicians and patient reluctance to participate
- Non compliance, the need to maintain high follow up rates

## Observational Studies

Classification:

- **Cohort studies:** Participant are defined according to their exposure levels and followed for disease control: exposure VS outcome.
- **Case control:** participant are defined as cases and controls and exposure histories are compared: outcome vs exposure
- **Analytic cross sectional study:** examines relationship between exposure and disease prevalence population in a defined population at a single point in time
- **Analytic ecologic studies:** examines relationship between exposure and disease with population level rather than individual level data can lead to ecological fallacy because exposure doesn’t necessarily mean outcome

### Cohort Studies:

Compares the occurrence of disease in groups of people with and without a particular exposure. A cohort is any designated group of persons who are followed or tracked over a period of time.  
Timing:

- Prospective (exposure has occurred, wait for outcome to occur),

</div>

- Retrospective (historical cohort study: both exposure and outcome has occurred)

    alt="cohort-retrospective"
  />
</div>

- Ambivalent (both prospective and retrospective phases)

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>

</div>

Follow up and outcome assessment: conclusions are drawn based on _measures of disease frequency_ as either exposure is **causal** or **protective.** More than one outdone is usually investigated (eg cigarette smoking; cancer, HTN etc), length of follow up depends on the outcome of interest. A longer follow up has higher risk of losses and expensive. Follow up rates should be as high as possible in order to ensure validity of
study

**Strengths**

- Efficient for rare exposure (based on exposure) e.g. an exposure to a chemical spill in a factory
- Good information on exposure (if prospective)
- Can evaluate multiple effects of an exposure
- Efficient for diseases with long induction and latent period (retrospective)
- Less vulnerable to bias (prospective)
- Can directly measure disease incidence or risk
- Clear temporal relationship between exposure and outcome (if prospective: exposure came before outcome)

**Limitations**

- Inefficient for rare outcomes
- Poor information on exposures and other key variables (retrospective)
- Expensive and time consuming (particularly prospective)
- Inefficient for diseases with long induction and latent periods (prospective)
- More vulnerable to bias (retrospective)

### Case Control Studies

First step is case definition. Cases are those affected by a disease of interest. Control (all eligibility criteria is same as case except for disease presence) is a sample of source of population that gave rise to the cases.

Divided based on outcome then check back for exposure. The quality of case control study can be as big as that of cohort study. More vulnerable to bias;

- **Selection bias** (meet eligibility criteria?)
- **Information bias** (interviewer bias (questions asked) and recall bias).

Selection of controls: should meet “would criterion”, Controls (and cases) should be sampled independent of exposure status: avoid selection bias

Checks what % of those that have disease have the exposure: if among the cases majority have exposure (exposure is causal) and if among control majority have the exposure (exposure is protective)

</div>

Other types:

- Nested case control studies
- Case cohort studies
- Case cross over studies

**Strengths**

- Efficient for rare diseases
- Divides based on outcome (less time and money)
- Efficient for diseases with long induction and latent periods
- Evaluate multiple
- Exposures: good for diseases which little is known

**Limitations**

- Inefficient for rare exposures
- May have poor information on exposure(because it is retrospective)
- Risk of bias because is retrospective (not good for weak association)
- Difficult to infer temporal relationship

</div>

### Ecologic Studies:

Evaluates _an association using the population rather than individual as the unit of analysis._

**Limitations**
**Ecological fallacy/ecological bias** (thinking that relationships observed for groups necessarily holds for individuals I.e error of attributing the characteristics of a population to an individual). An apparent relation could be due to **confounding**

**Strengths**

- Low cost (takes a short time and are inexpensive because relies on pre-existing data)
- Cover a wider range of exposure levels than a typical individual level study)
- Ability to examine contextual effects on health eg religion, community economics & politics
- Help to generate or develop hypothesis eg high prevalence of DM & obese vs low prevalence of DM & obesity in two different communities

### Cross-sectional Studies

Looks at the relation between two aspects of health in a ‘cross section’ of the population at a single point in time.

:::tip NOTE
Cross-sectional studies can be both descriptive and analytic (answers the question why)
:::

Participants are selected _without regard to exposure or disease/outcome status._ To avoid selection bias, sample should be representative of the whole population (thus cross sectional study used for prevalence): facilitate generalizability. For public health planning and causal research.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/VsHlBiy.png" alt="cross-sectional" />
</div>

Strengths

- Highly generalizable: when based on a sample of the population
- Low cost (done in a short period of time)
- Examine rates of disease in a population (prevalence)

Limitations

- Preponderance/predominance of prevalent cases of long duration/slow progressing disease compared to rapid progressing (each type can have different RFs)
- Healthy worker survivor effect
- Cannot infer temporal sequence between exposure and disease (possibility of reverse causality; low weight vs cancer)

:::warning NOTE
Exception to infer temporal relationship in case of unaltered characteristics (eg genetic trait) and _avoided if the exposure measure reflects not only present but also past exposure._
:::

## Which design is appropriate?

Determined by:

- Research question; ideal and practical design to answer the question
- State of knowledge
- Frequency of the exposure and disease; rare exposure vs rare outcome
- Expected strength of the association (validity); study that has less bias
- Practical and ethical consideration
- Costs (efficiency) eg experimental is expensive compared to retrospective cohort study
- Availability of sustainable study population and records; with retrospective cohort choose where records are well placed
