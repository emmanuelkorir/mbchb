# Introduction to Epidemiology

Dr Chesang

## Definitions

- Public health: The community effort to protect, maintain and improve the health of a population by organized means including preventative programs, hygiene, education and other intervention. It’s a multidisciplinary field whose goal is to promote the health of population through organized community efforts

- Epidemiology: Study what is upon the people. It’s the study of the distribution and determinants of disease frequency in human population and the disease frequency in human populations and the application of this study to control health problem.

Concerned with: What disease/condition is present in excess? Who is ill? Where do they live When did they become ill? Why did they become ill?

Epidemiology is about measuring ill health, identifying the causes of ill health and intervening to improve health. It’s most fundamental role is to provide logic and structure for the analysis of health problems and the sound use of numbers. Be open, alert to potential error, willing to consider alternative explanation and finally constructively critical and pragmatic. Epidemiology directly affects lives of most people ‘study of what is upon the people: ‘epi-demos-logy’

What does epidemiology offer?

- Description of health status of populations: detect sudden (and not so sudden) changes in the level of disease. Clues regarding disease causation. Health authorities and planners: Nature and burden of disease
- Causation: Genetic and environmental factors: identification of modifiable factors allow preventative interventions
- Evaluation of intervention: primary prevention programmes, treatments and assessments of the effectiveness of health service
- Natural history and prognosis (in individual and groups): Discussing treatment options, planning and evaluating intervention, would screening be effective?

Studies done:

- Descriptive studies: person, place, time
- Analytic studies: Association between potential causal agents and diseases. Based on groups of individuals, not large scale population statistics. Is it causal?
- Intervention studies: Evaluate new preventative measures, programmes or treatment. Monitor the effectiveness of these intervention programmes after they have been implemented

## Sources of epidemiological data

There are two types of data:

- Primary data: Collected afresh and for the first time
- Secondary data: have already been collected by someone else. May be published or unpublished. Not collected with the aim of answering any specific question Data collection after research problem, objectives and study design have been defined

Routine data collection systems can provide information on the exposure (s) and outcome (s) of interest in an epidemiological study

### Sources of routine data/secondary data

- Censuses and population registers
- Birth and death certificates
- Disease registration (cancer registers, notifiable infectious diseases)
- Health information systems
- Record linkage
- Medical and hospital records

Routine data: Governments, healthcare providers and statistical agencies. Counts of individual health events and rates. The most used measures of ill health are those collected and reported at national and regional levels for internal planning and evaluation. Mortality data: generally easier to obtain and more reliable than morbidity data: but not perfect.

Death certificates: Include name, date of birth, ethnicity, gender, the date and cause (s) of death Accurate for occurrence of death: less accurate for cause of death Mid diagnosis or mis specification on the form Some diseases are recorded more accurately than others Reluctance to record information due to stigma or fear of Blane

#### Verbal autopsy

Disease registries: cancer, notifiable infectious diseases Hospital records: Information on conditions that require hospitalization Risk of misdiagnosis, mis recording and mis coding Representativeness (disease of interest and the hospital Choice of numerator for morbidity rate: lack of unique identifier No data on community morbidity

Challenges of using secondary data: I. Varying reliability, quality and completeness II. Data collected for a reason other than your question III. Advantage: someone else has already done the homework

Creative use of existing data: Descriptive studies (who, what, where and when) Starting to link exposure and disease (why) It can also be used in migrant and ecological studies

## History of epidemiology

- **Hippocrates of Cos (460-370 BC; a Greek physician):** Both environmental and behavioral factors affect disease occurrence (air, waters and places)

- **Avicenna (Ibn Sina) (980-1037: a Persian philosopher, scientist and physician):** He inferred from his observations that some infectious disease were spread by contagion, and he suggested the use of quarantine to limit their spread

- **Frascastoro (1478-1553:** post and physician from Verona): extended the concept of contagion by suggesting a theory that disease was spread through self replicating particles (direct, indirect and distant transmission

- **John Graunt (1620-1674; a London heberdasher):** known as the world’s first epidemiologist and demographer. Used routinely collected data (Bills mortality). Constructed the 1st life table

- **James Lind (1739-1794, Scottish doctor):** mid 1700s: conducted sone of the earliest epidemiological studies of treatment effectiveness when he demonstrated that bloodletting did not aid recovery from disease

- **William Farr (1807-1883):** First complied of abstracts at the general register office in England (births, marriages and death), occupied himself with many of the same issues that Graubt addressed. Local and comparatively small charges in attitude were strongly related to mortality from cholera (four air was the medium by which cholera was spread) John Snow (1813-1858): considered the founding father of both epidemiology and anesthesiology

- **Ignasz semmelweis (1818-1856, obstetrician, Hungary):** Vienna maternity hospital: puerperal Fever

- **Florence nightingale (1820-1910):** was also an epidemiologist abs statistician. Crime war; sickness took a much greater toll than injuries. Instigated improvements such as better sewage and ventilation

- **Janet Lane Claypon (1877-1967):** inventor of modern case control study; 1926; Risk factors for breast cancer

- **Modern studies:** streptomycin: TB trial (Sir Austin Bradford Hill, 1946). _Doll and Hill’s studies on smoking and lung cancer (Richard Doll and Hill, 1950)._ The Framingham study
