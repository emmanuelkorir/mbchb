# Sample Designs

Dr Chesang

## Definitions

A Population: is the aggregate of all cases that conform to some designated set of specifications

Study population (reference/target): group we want to study dependent on research problem

Census inquiry/survey: a complete enumeration of all items in the population. Every individual in the population is measured

Sample: a subset of the population

Sampling unit: a single member of sampling population: basic elements of the sampled population eg. Households, individuals, an event, City, University etc

Finite population: contains a countable number of sampling units

Infinite population: consists of an endless number of sampling units

Sampling frame: a listing of sampling units; errors in sampling frames may lead to selection bias

Parameter: an attribute found in the population that can be measured

Statistic: counterpart of parameter in a sample

Sample design: the technique or the procedure used in selecting items for the sample

A small number of cases (a sample) is used as the basis for making inferences about all the cases (population). For accurate estimation of unknown parameters from known statistics, need to know: the definition of population, the sample design and the size of the sample.

## Sample designs

There are two main types of sampling:

1. Probability sample/Random sampling
2. Non probability sample

### Probability sample designs

Probability sample designs (also known as **random sampling** or **chance sampling**). Each sampling unit has a known probability of being selected. Best technique of selecting a representative sample. Possible to estimate population parameters from sample statistics; also margin of error statistically determinable.

Includes:

- Simple random sampling
- Systemic sampling
- Stratified sampling
- Cluster sampling
- Sequential sampling
- Multi state sampling

1.  **Simple random sampling**

Each sampling unit has an equal and non non zero probability of being selected (1/N) and _all choices are independent of one another_. Procedure: Sampling frame(a listing of sampling units). Assign unique id number to each sampling unit. Select sampling unit randomly(computer selected, random table etc).

2. **Systematic sampling**

Consists of selecting every Kth (K=N/n) sampling unit of the population after the first sampling unit is selected at random (N = total population, n = sample size). Procedure: Complete sampling frame. Assign unique id number. Sampling interval. Select the first sample unit randomly. Every kth person is selected. Pattern: bias the sample. Each stamping unit in the population has a 1/K probability of being included in the sample.

3. **Stratified sampling**

The goal is to achieve desired representation from various subgroups in the population so as to increase the level of accuracy when estimating parameters. Procedure: Criteria for stratification Representation in each stratum Stratify the sampling frame(age, sex, nationality etc. based on research question). Stratification can be done on more than one variable. Sampling from different strata can be either _proportional_ or _disproportional_. Method of sampling from each strata: simple or or systematic random sampling.

Advantages

- Ensure all strata are represented in the sample
- Precision of overall estimates may be greater than those of SRS
- Produces estimates of stratum specific outcome

4. **Cluster sampling**

A larger grouping (clusters intact groups) is selected followed by selection of sampling unit from that clusters. Procedure: Select the clusters: random or stratified sampling. Select sampling units within the clusters, all or by random or stratified sampling. Choice of clusters depend on research objectives and resources available. Limited generalizability.

Multistage cluster sampling: first stage cluster sampling, second stage cluster sampling.

area probability sampling or area sampling: give clusters some geographic subdivisions.

5. **Sequential sampling**

Sampling units are selected one after another as long as desired. Used in rare cases.

6. **Multi stage sampling**

Good when covering a large geographic area. Random selection at all stages; multi stage random sampling. Can use purposive sampling.

### Non probability sample designs (also called biased, deliberate)

Does not afford any basis for estimating the probability that each item in the population has of being included in the sample. Include:

- Convenience sampling
- Purposive sampling
- Quota sampling
- Snowball sampling (respondent driven sampling)

1. **Convenience sampling (convenient, volunteer or accidental sampling)**

Whatever sampling units are conveniently available are selected. It cannot be used for statistical inference; not representative of any specific population.

2. **Purposive sampling (judgement samples)**

A researcher uses cases that have the required information with respect to the objectives of the study. The criteria for choosing the particular cases must be specified. Difficult to determine the probability of the inclusion of any specific sampling unit in the sample. _Can be used as part of multistage sampling procedure._

3. **Quota sampling**

A specific number of individuals are selected from each of several nonoverlapping group. Sampling proceeds until the totals or quotas are reached in each group. Main purpose: To select a sample that is similar as possible to the sampling population. A lack of similarity between the sample and the population is likely to occur with respect to those variables that are not in the interview’s quoatas. Population’s parameter cannot be accurately estimated from the findings

Difference with stratified sampling.

> Stratified sampling: individuals within each strata are selected at random. Quota sampling: participants are purposively selected until the quota is reached.

4. **Snowball sampling (chain referral sampling)**

Initial subjects are identified by purposive sampling technique. Referral to subsequent subjects. Useful when study population not well known (have a rare characteristics).

## Which sampling technique?

Guided by:

- Objectives of the study
- The study population and size
- Sample size required
- Sampling unit/frame
- Logistical considerations
