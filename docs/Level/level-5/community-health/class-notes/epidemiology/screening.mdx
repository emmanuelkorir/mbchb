# Screening

Dr Chesang

The presumptive identification of an unrecognized disease or defect by the application of tests, examinations or other procedures which can be applied rapidly.

**Screening test:**

- Sort out apparently well known person who probably have disease from those who probably do not
- Are not intended to be diagnostic
- Person with positive or suspicious findings must be referred for diagnosis and treatment

Can either be directed at the whole population (**mass screening**) or focused on groups considered to be at high risk of developing the disease(**selective screening**).

Assumption: early detection improves prognosis

**Screening versus case finding**

**Lead time:** the amount of time that the disease diagnosis is advanced by screening

Has both beneficial and detrimental effect

### Reasons for screening

- Personal benefit: reduced morbidity, mortality and/or disability
- Wider social benefits if overall health costs are reduced
- To protect others
- Financial reasons

### Negative consequences of a screening program

1. Negative results

- Anxiety
- False reassurance
- Cost and inconvenience

2. Positive results

- Fall positive: complications
- Unnecessary treatment
- Adverse effects of labeling someone as having a disease or early diagnosis
- Anxiety
- Costs and the inconvenience

### Requirement of a screening program

- The sustainability of a disease for screening
- The quality and acceptability of screening tests must be demonstrated
- The whole programme must be shown to confer a net benefit to the community

### Appropriate disease for screening

- Severe, prevalent and perceived as a public health problem by the community
- A good understanding of the natural history of the disease. Critical point. Treatment at an earlier stage should be of more benefit than at a later stage.
- The disease should have a reasonably long preclinical phase so that the prevalence is high

### Screening program

The program is demonstrably effective in practice. The healthcare system can cope with the extra diagnostic testing and treatment.

## Screening tests

- Accurate (valid)
- Reliable (precision): although a valid test is always reliable, a reliable test is not always valid
- Safe and acceptable to the population being screened
- Simple and cheap

Intervals for repeating the test should be determined (intervals should ideally be shorter than the **_sojourn time_** - duration of pre-clinical detectable phase of the disease)

### Test quality sensitivity and specificity

The performance of a test is evaluated by comparing the results with the ‘gold standard’. For tests to be accurate it should produce few false positive and false negative results. A combination of a high sensitivity and a high specificity is essential for a good screening test.

|                         |          | Disease                             | Status                              |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
|                         |          | Positive                            | Negative                            |
| <strong>Test</strong>   | Positive | True Positives (<strong>a</strong>) | False Positive (<strong>b</strong>) |
| <strong>Result</strong> | Negative | False negative (<strong>c</strong>) | True Negatives (<strong>d</strong>) |

- **Sensitivity:** the sensitivity of a test measures how well it classifies people with the disease as sick. It is the percentage of people with the disease who test positive.

`Sensitivity = True Positives ÷ All with positives x 100%`

</div>

- **Specificity:** the specificity of a test measures how well it classifies people without the disease as healthy. It’s a percentage of people without the disease who test negative

`Specificity = True Negatives ÷ All without disease x 100%`

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/pOM9biV.png" alt="specificity" />
</div>

In the usual service setting we cannot measure either the sensitivity or specificity of the test.

The denominator (a+c) and (b+d) is determined by

- a _gold standard diagnostic test_ or
- _the population is followed for a period of time to determine who develops the disease._

### The tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity

- A particular criterion of positivity is selected in order to maximize the validity of a screening test
- Continuous scale: high sensitivity is obtained at the cost of low specificity and vice versa
- Cutoff determines the number of false positive and negative test results
- Determined by the consequences of either

One way to summarize the validity of a continuous measurement is the plot sensitive against (1-specificity) for different cutoff values; this curve is called the **receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC)**

Purpose: is to select the optimal cut off point for distinguishing between the disease and the non diseased individual/

:::warning NOTE
Screening tests used to identify disease in asymptomatic individuals (e.g., mammogram for breast cancer, Pap smear for cervical cancer) & it should have a high sensitivity. On the other hand, a confirmatory test confirms disease in individuals with signs or symptoms of the disease (e.g., biopsy for breast cancer or cervical cancer). Usually performed after a screening test to confirm a diagnosis. Should have a high specificity. Thus, a highly sensitive test can rule out a disease if negative, and a highly specific test can rule in a disease if positive
:::

### Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve

The closer the ROC curve of a particular test is to the top left hand corner of the box, where both sensitivity and specificity are maximized, the better the test: the better the ability to differentiate between diseased and non diseased
A test with a curve that lies on the diagonal (45 degree line) is for practical purposes useless, and no other than a complete guess.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>

</div>

:::note INTERPRETING ROC curve
The ROC curve illustrates the relationship between the sensitivity and specificity of a test. The more closely the curve follows the Y axis, the more accurate the test. The more close the curve is to the diagonal dotted line (x = y), the less accurate the test. When choosing a cutoff value, an upward shift on the ROC curve indicates increased sensitivity and a shift to the right indicates decreased specificity.
:::

The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) also allows the usefulness of tests to be compared: The larger the AUROC, the higher the accuracy of the test.

- AUROC close to 1.0 indicates that the test has high combined sensitivity and specificity.
- AUROC closer to 0.5 indicates poor discriminative ability.

**Cutoff values**

- **Low cutoff value:** low sensitivity (high FP) and high specificity (low FN)
- **High cutoff value:** high sensitivity (low FP) and low specificity (high FN)

## Test performance in practice: PPV and NPV

Provides the probability that an individual has/does not have a disease in question given that they test positive/negative. Affected by true prevalence and sensitivity and specificity of the test.

They measure how well a test performs in a given population. Reflect both accuracy of the test (sensitivity and specificity) and the disease prevalence in the population tested. Low PPV if the disease is rare.

:::tip
When prevalence is high, PPV is high and vice versa.
:::

**Positive predictive value**
PP: how likely it is that a positive test results indicate the presence of a disease. PPV is _influenced more by specificity than sensitivity_ because _the specificity determines the number of false positive results_. It is the percentage of all people who test positive who really have the disease.

</div>

:::tip Note
The PPV increases with increasing prevalence of a disease in the population. Directly correlates with pre-test probability. The probability that an individual who tested positive actually does not have the disease: 1 - PPV.
:::

**Negative predictive value**
Percentage of all people who test negative who really do not have the disease.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bgm7kI1.png" alt="npv" />
</div>

:::tip NOTE
The NPV decreases with increasing prevalence of the disease. It inversely correlates with pre-test probability. The probability that an individual who tested negative actually has the disease: 1 - NPV.
:::

## Clinical epidemiology

1. **Pretest probability:** prevalence (probability of a condition before the test). The probability that a patient with a particular manifestation has a specific disease before the result of the diagnostic test is known.

**Features**

- The pretest probability of a disease is reflected by its prevalence in a particular region.
- NPVs and PPVs depend on the test subject's pretest probability of disease (unlike sensitivity and specificity).
- A higher pretest probability will decrease the NPV and increase the PPV.
- A lower pretest probability will increase the NPV and decrease the PPV.

2. **Post test probability:** PV (probability of disease on the basis of results). The probability that a patient has a particular disease after a diagnostic test is carried out

**Features**

- Combines disease prevalence and sensitivity and specificity of a test to quantify the likelihood of a patient having a disease
- Can be determined using formulas or nomograms

3. **True prevalence (pre-test prevalence):** the proportion of the population that is truly diseased ( `(a+c) ÷ n` ).Unless test is perfect test results only provide an estimate of true prevalence
4. **Apparent prevalence (post-test prevalence):** the proportion of tested individual that are positive ( `(a+b) ÷ n` )

## Reliability (also called repeatability or reproducibility)

It is a _measure of the consistency of the performance of a test when used under similar circumstances._ To be valid, a measurement **must** be reliable. However, _reliability is not in itself sufficient for validity._

Variability may be due to biological, observer or instrument variation. Reliability studies assess the extent to which results agree when obtained by different observers, study instrument or procedures or by the same observer, study instrument or procedure at different points in time

**Checks**

- Intra observer or intra measurement reliability
- Inter observer/measurement reliability

**Percentage agreement:** obtained by dividing the number of paired observations in the agreement cells by the total number of paired observations

Agreement refers to how well 2 tests agree

- **Intra observer/measurement agreement:** agreement between responses from the observer/tests on the same subject on 2 or more occasions separated by the time
- **Inter observer/measurement agreement:** agreement etween responses from 2 or more observers/tests on the same subject

## Evaluation of a screening programmes

Outcomes used to evaluate the success of a screening program include:

- **Process measures:** the number of people who have been screened and the number of cases of disease that have been detected by screening. Do not gauge screening effectiveness. Positive predictive value of the screening test being used.
- **Survival:** compare the survival of screen detected cases with that of unscreened cases.

:::tip
Survival rate used in diseases that take longer eg. cancer
:::

- **Shift in stage distribution:** comparison of disease stage distribution among individuals identified by screening versus those identified by other methods.
- **Mortality (overload and cause specific):** compare mortality rates between screened and unscreened populations.

## Study designs to evaluate screening programmes

1. **Experimental studies: randomized studies**
   The initial evaluation of a nobel screening program requires a randomized trial to allow concerns about these varied threats to validity. Randomized then followed for outcomes of interest (morbidity, mortality, survival). Eliminates known and unknown confounding. Avoids volunteer bias. It can give estimates of lead time and evaluate the impact of length bias sampling. Requires many participants (moderate efficacy).\*\* May take many years and time and effort to ensure good follow up

2. **Observational studies**

- Cohort: participants decide weather to base screened; followed to ascertain the outcome of interest
- Case control: compare those with and without disease with respect to their history of screening
- Ecological studies: compares outcome measure among many populations at the same time or the same population at different times
