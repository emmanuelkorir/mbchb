### Question 1

An 18 month old boy from Western Kenya presents with recurrent jaundice and painful swelling of the fingers and toes. He has previously required hospitalization thrice for blood transfusion. 

a. State the most likely diagnosis in this child (2 marks)

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
Sickle cell anemia - 
</details>

b. List Investigations you would perform to guide management of this child (5 marks)

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
<ul>
    <li>CBC: normocytic normochromic anemia</li>
    <li>Reticulocyte count</li>
    <li>Blood film morphology: On peripheral smear, irreversibly sickled RBCs may be seen, polychromasia and
 presence of nucleated red blood cells which are in keeping with the hemolytic process.
 RBC inclusions -Howell Jolly bodies - that may indicate splenic dysfunction may be seen.</li>
    <li>Sickling test</li>
    <li>Haemoglobin Electrophoresis: </li>
    <li>High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)</li>
    <li>Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)</li>
    <li>Isoelectric Focusing (IEF)</li>
    <li>Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)</li>
    <li>Haptoglobin</li>
    <li>LFT: Total serum bilirubin</li>
</ul>
</details>


c. What are the acute complications associated with this disease (6 marks)

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
<p>1. Vaso-occlusive crisis:
<ul>
    <li>Dactylitis, severe back pain, pain localized to specific limbs (upper or lower limbs), chest pain or
abdominal pain</li>
    <li>Acute chest syndrome (fever with new onset shortness
of breath)</li>
    <li>Stroke (manifest as weakness of limbs depending on region affected or other
neurological sequalae)</li>
    <li>Priapism</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>2. Aplastic crisis</p>
<p>3. Hemolytic crisis: symptomatic anemia presenting as fatigue/extreme tiredness or
decreased activity or irritability with increasing jaundice (yellowness of eyes, palms and
soles of feet in pediatric population)</p>
<p>4. Sequestration crisis: Splenic sequestration causing a rapidly enlarging splenomegaly that can lead to infarction.
</p>

<p>Chronic presentation:
    <ul>
        <li>Gallstones sometimes predisposing to acute cholecystitis</li>
        <li>Chronic leg ulcers</li>
        <li>Avascular necrosis of the head of the femur causing limping with shortened limb</li>
        <li>Target organ disease e.g. renal dysfunction, cardiac etc</li>
    </ul>
</p>
</details>

d. Discuss the preventive strategies for this patient and their family during outpatient follow up(12 marks)

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
<p>Keeping warm</p>
<p>Hydration</p>
<p>Penicillin prophylaxis: Patients with SCD are prone to infection and death from encapsulated bacterial organisms
like Streptococcal pneumoniae due to splenic dysfunction that occurs within the first 5 years
of life. It is therefore recommended that children with SCD should have penicillin prophylaxis
started within 2 months of life and continued until 5 years of age. However, for patients who
have had surgical splenectomy, it is given for life. Its use may be continued until later in life
for children who have had more than two episodes of severe pneumonia. The dose of:
<ul>
    <li>Children less than 3 years: Penicillin V syrup 125mg twice daily</li>
    <li>Children more than 3 years: Penicillin V syrup/tablets 250mg twice daily</li>
    <li>Patients with penicillin hypersensitivity may use erythromycin as an alternative</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Immunization practices:
    <ul>
        <li>Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (Pneumo-23): At 2 years and once every 5years</li>
        <li>Influenza vaccine: Annually</li>
        <li>Meningococcal vaccine: 2 doses for those below 2 years of age and one
dose for those above 2years</li>
        <li>Hemophilus influenza type B: Booster at 18months</li>
        <li>Neisseria meningitidis</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Hydroxyurea use: It reduces painful crisis, blood transfusion and
infection in patients with SCD. </p>
<p>Chronic Transfusion Therapy: The aim of chronic transfusion therapy is to keep the HbS level <30%. Indicated in primary stroke prevention, recurrent acute chest syndrome, pulmonary htn, leg ulcers.</p>
<p>Pain management using analgesics like PCM, NSAIDS, or morphine. Mild pain management using hot packs, reassurance, reposition & massage.</p>
<p>Psychosocial Support: Patients go
through periods of pain, requirements for inpatient care with separation from their families or
daily activities, physiological changes in their bodies due to the chronic hemolysis and the
potential threat of SCD complications. Parents experience guilt of having passed the sickle
cell gene to their child, challenges of watching their children experience the complications of
SCD like pain, absenteeism from work as they regularly seek health care for their children and
the financial drain of the disease. Adults with SCD sometimes also experience stigma when
choosing marital partners and when making career choices. This necessitates that patients
and their families are offered psychosocial support within the healthcare system or as part of
patient support groups.</p>
<p>Nutritional Support: SCD patients should eat diets with healthy nutritious foods just like other normal children.
Parents should be encouraged to give their children plenty of water or fluids. Folic acid
supplementation is necessary due to its increased demand from the chronic hemolysis</p>
<p>Malaria Prophylaxis: SCD patients are susceptible to malaria infection which may have serious consequences. It is
recommended that for patients living in high transmission malaria areas or non-immune
individuals that prophylactic antimalarial drugs are used in addition to the general
precautions (e.g. use of insecticide treated mosquito nets and environmental measures).
Patients living in low malarial transmission zones do not require prophylaxis. Drugs that can be used for prophylaxis are proguanil or mefloquine.</p>
<p>Routine Clinic Follow Ups: Patients with SCD require to be reviewed regularly at least once every 8-12 weeks. The
following algorithms can be used for the first and subsequent clinic visits.</p>
