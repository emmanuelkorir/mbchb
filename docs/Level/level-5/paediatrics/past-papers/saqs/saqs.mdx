d. Discuss the preventive strategies for this patient and their family during outpatient follow up(12 marks)

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
  <p>Keeping warm</p>
  <p>Hydration</p>
  <p>
    Penicillin prophylaxis: Patients with SCD are prone to infection
    and death from encapsulated bacterial organisms like Streptococcal
    pneumoniae due to splenic dysfunction that occurs within the first
    5 years of life. It is therefore recommended that children with
    SCD should have penicillin prophylaxis started within 2 months of
    life and continued until 5 years of age. However, for patients who
    have had surgical splenectomy, it is given for life. Its use may
    be continued until later in life for children who have had more
    than two episodes of severe pneumonia. The dose of:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Children less than 3 years: Penicillin V syrup 125mg twice
        daily
      </li>
      <li>
        Children more than 3 years: Penicillin V syrup/tablets 250mg
        twice daily
      </li>
      <li>
        Patients with penicillin hypersensitivity may use erythromycin
        as an alternative
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Immunization practices:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (Pneumo-23): At 2 years
        and once every 5years
      </li>
      <li>Influenza vaccine: Annually</li>
      <li>
        Meningococcal vaccine: 2 doses for those below 2 years of age
        and one dose for those above 2years
      </li>
      <li>Hemophilus influenza type B: Booster at 18months</li>
      <li>Neisseria meningitidis</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Hydroxyurea use: It reduces painful crisis, blood transfusion and
    infection in patients with SCD.{' '}
  </p>
  <p>
    Chronic Transfusion Therapy: The aim of chronic transfusion
    therapy is to keep the HbS level less than 30%. Indicated in
    primary stroke prevention, recurrent acute chest syndrome,
    pulmonary htn, leg ulcers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pain management using analgesics like PCM, NSAIDS, or morphine.
    Mild pain management using hot packs, reassurance, reposition &
    massage.
  </p>
  <p>
    Psychosocial Support: Patients go through periods of pain,
    requirements for inpatient care with separation from their
    families or daily activities, physiological changes in their
    bodies due to the chronic hemolysis and the potential threat of
    SCD complications. Parents experience guilt of having passed the
    sickle cell gene to their child, challenges of watching their
    children experience the complications of SCD like pain,
    absenteeism from work as they regularly seek health care for their
    children and the financial drain of the disease. Adults with SCD
    sometimes also experience stigma when choosing marital partners
    and when making career choices. This necessitates that patients
    and their families are offered psychosocial support within the
    healthcare system or as part of patient support groups.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nutritional Support: SCD patients should eat diets with healthy
    nutritious foods just like other normal children. Parents should
    be encouraged to give their children plenty of water or fluids.
    Folic acid supplementation is necessary due to its increased
    demand from the chronic hemolysis
  </p>
  <p>
    Malaria Prophylaxis: SCD patients are susceptible to malaria
    infection which may have serious consequences. It is recommended
    that for patients living in high transmission malaria areas or
    non-immune individuals that prophylactic antimalarial drugs are
    used in addition to the general precautions (e.g. use of
    insecticide treated mosquito nets and environmental measures).
    Patients living in low malarial transmission zones do not require
    prophylaxis. Drugs that can be used for prophylaxis are proguanil
    or mefloquine.
  </p>
  <p>
    Routine Clinic Follow Ups: Patients with SCD require to be
    reviewed regularly at least once every 8-12 weeks. The following
    algorithms can be used for the first and subsequent clinic visits.

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
  <p>
    Absorbed through the skin, respiratory system or gastrointestinal
    system. Irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase(AChE) by
    phosphorylating the serine hydroxyl group located at the active
    site of AChE. Over a period of time, phosphorylation is followed
    by loss of an organophosphate leaving group and the bond with AChE
    becomes irreversible, a process called aging. Increase in
    acetylcholine levels. Activation of muscarinic and nicotinic
    acetylcholine receptors. Result in life threatening activation of
    the parasympathetic nervous system.

e. Describe your initial management plan. (5 marks)

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
  <p>
    Ensure your safety putting on PPEs & patient's safety. Remove
    patient from site of exposure
  </p>
  <p>
    Airway support such as suction due to increased secretions
    associated with organophosphates poisoning, oropharyngeal airway
    and sniffing position. Positioning the patient in recovery
    position may also help with drainage of secretions from oral
    cavity
  </p>
  <p>
    Breathing. If breathing is not adequate based on signs of
    respiratory distress give supplemental oxygenation titrating based
    on need. If there is respiratory failure, endotracheal intubation
    may be necessary{' '}
  </p>
  <p>
    Circulation. In case of impaired circulation, adequate volume
    resuscitation with isotonic crystalloids(Ringer's lactate)
  </p>
  <p>
    Decontamination. In case of topical exposure with potential dermal
    exposure, remove all clothes and gently cleanse patients with soap
    and water because organophosphates are hydrolized readily in
    aqeous solutions with a high pH. Discard patient's clothes.
    Irrigate the eyes in case of ocular exposure using isotonic
    solutions sa Ringer's lactate.
  </p>
  <p>
    Activated charcoal to patient's presenting within one hour of
    organophosphate ingestion.{' '}
  </p>
</details>

f. What medications are required in the treatment and what is their mechanism of action? (6 marks)

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
  <p>
    Atropine. Acts as competitive antagonist at muscarinic
    acetylcholine receptors only. Given at 0.02 mg/kg IV repeated
    every 5 mins. Signs of atropinization include warm, dry, flushed
    skin, dilated pupils(mydriasis) and tachycardia. Atropine as IV
    infusion after atropinization. Continued for at least 24 hours
    until organophosphate is metabolized. Atropine does not bind to
    nicotinic receptors hence ineffective in treating neuromuscular
    dysfunction.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pralidoxime & other oximes (Obidoxime). Acts by regenerating
    acetylcholinesterase by dephosphorylation. Function peripherally
    on both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. Should only be
    administered after atropine due to risk of transient worsening of
    acetylcholinesterase inhibition.
  </p>
  <p>
    Benzodiazepines. To control organophosphate-induced seizures. Acts
    by binding GABA-A receptors and increasing the frequency of
    channel opening.
  </p>
