  <p>
    Penicillin prophylaxis: Patients with SCD are prone to infection
    and death from encapsulated bacterial organisms like Streptococcal
    pneumoniae due to splenic dysfunction that occurs within the first
    5 years of life. It is therefore recommended that children with
    SCD should have penicillin prophylaxis started within 2 months of
    life and continued until 5 years of age. However, for patients who
    have had surgical splenectomy, it is given for life. Its use may
    be continued until later in life for children who have had more
    than two episodes of severe pneumonia. The dose of:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Children less than 3 years: Penicillin V syrup 125mg twice
        daily
      </li>
      <li>
        Children more than 3 years: Penicillin V syrup/tablets 250mg
        twice daily
      </li>
      <li>
        Patients with penicillin hypersensitivity may use erythromycin
        as an alternative
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Immunization practices:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (Pneumo-23): At 2 years
        and once every 5years
      </li>
      <li>Influenza vaccine: Annually</li>
      <li>
        Meningococcal vaccine: 2 doses for those below 2 years of age
        and one dose for those above 2years
      </li>
      <li>Hemophilus influenza type B: Booster at 18months</li>
      <li>Neisseria meningitidis</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Hydroxyurea use: It reduces painful crisis, blood transfusion and
    infection in patients with SCD.{' '}
  </p>
  <p>
    Chronic Transfusion Therapy: The aim of chronic transfusion
    therapy is to keep the HbS level less than 30%. Indicated in
    primary stroke prevention, recurrent acute chest syndrome,
    pulmonary htn, leg ulcers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pain management using analgesics like PCM, NSAIDS, or morphine.
    Mild pain management using hot packs, reassurance, reposition &
    massage.
  </p>
  <p>
    Psychosocial Support: Patients go through periods of pain,
    requirements for inpatient care with separation from their
    families or daily activities, physiological changes in their
    bodies due to the chronic hemolysis and the potential threat of
    SCD complications. Parents experience guilt of having passed the
    sickle cell gene to their child, challenges of watching their
    children experience the complications of SCD like pain,
    absenteeism from work as they regularly seek health care for their
    children and the financial drain of the disease. Adults with SCD
    sometimes also experience stigma when choosing marital partners
    and when making career choices. This necessitates that patients
    and their families are offered psychosocial support within the
    healthcare system or as part of patient support groups.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nutritional Support: SCD patients should eat diets with healthy
    nutritious foods just like other normal children. Parents should
    be encouraged to give their children plenty of water or fluids.
    Folic acid supplementation is necessary due to its increased
    demand from the chronic hemolysis
  </p>
  <p>
    Malaria Prophylaxis: SCD patients are susceptible to malaria
    infection which may have serious consequences. It is recommended
    that for patients living in high transmission malaria areas or
    non-immune individuals that prophylactic antimalarial drugs are
    used in addition to the general precautions (e.g. use of
    insecticide treated mosquito nets and environmental measures).
    Patients living in low malarial transmission zones do not require
    prophylaxis. Drugs that can be used for prophylaxis are proguanil
    or mefloquine.
  </p>
  <p>
    Routine Clinic Follow Ups: Patients with SCD require to be
    reviewed regularly at least once every 8-12 weeks. The following
    algorithms can be used for the first and subsequent clinic visits.

</details>


Describe the pathogenesis of acute glomerulonephritis


<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>


Streptococcal infection produces antibodies which makes an immune complex with antigen and complement C3. They deposit in the glomerular basement membrane forming subepithelial humps. This leads to acute inflammation which eventually leads to proliferation of mesangial and endothelial cells and glomerular endothelial damage. There is obstruction of glomerular capillaries which reduce glomerular blood flow and GFR leading oliguria, fluid retention, hypovolemia and edema. This also activates the juxtaglomerular apparatus and the RAAS system leading hypertension. There is also hematuria and proteinuria.

#### Question 5

You receive a 4kg newborn aged 2hours who is reported to be a term baby, born after prolonged 2nd stage of labour due to cephalo-pelvic disproportion. The baby is given extensive resuscitation and is noted to start convulsing by the age of 2 hours. He had an Apgar score of 2 at 1 min and 3 at 5 mins.

What is the likely diagnosis?
<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
Perinatal asphyxia
</details>


Discuss briefly the pathophysiology from initial insult to onset of convulsions

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
Hypoxic ischemic insult leads to reduced oxygen and depletion of glucose. This reduces ATP which causes anaerobic metabolism leading to failure of the ATP
dependant sodium potassium pump which leads to neuronal membrane
depolarization because of the increased intracellular sodium, calcium and
extracellular glutamate levels. Synaptic cleft floods with glutamate which activates NMDA and AMPA receptors, this leads to a calcium influx into the cell which increases intracellular calcium levels and excitatory amino acid levels. This activates nitric oxide synthase, which causes neurotoxicity and inflammation and leads to cell edema due to influx of water intracellularly. Eventually there is mitochondrial disruption, release of O3 and reduced glutathione. Primary energy failure (minutes )leads to cell death and early necrosis. Partial recovery of oxidative metabolism and acidosis leads to reperfusion which partially reduces excitatory amino acids and edema. Secondary energy failure (hours to days) is characterized by cell death and late
apoptosis. Finally there is chronic brain injury (weeks to months), delayed cerebral atrophy and cell loss. There is reduced cell metabolism resulting in cytotoxic edema, seizures, raised cytokine levels and mitochondrial failure

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
Respiratory distress syndrome
</details>


5 main clinical signs of this condition and explain the pathogenesis of each in one sentence
<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
Lungs: Manifested by: Progressive signs of respiratory distress are noted soon after
birth and include
Tachypnea (greater than 60 / min) & working alae nasi
Intercostal & subcostal retractions
Expiratory grunting (from partial closure of glottis)
Central cyanosis, disturbed consciousness
Extremely immature neonates may develop apnea and/or irregular
respirations
Patients may also have edema, ileus, and oliguria
Due to: reduced surfactant → increases alveolar surface tension → diffuse
alveolar collapse (atelectasis) during expiration → higher pressure required to
inflate lung → increased work of breathing with impaired gas exchange →
hypoxemia, hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis

CNS failure: Manifested by:
Slow, irregular, gasping respiration.
Apneic attacks.

Disturbed consciousness.
Poor reflexes
Due to: Over sedation, Perinatal asphyxia, Intracranial hemorrhage
</details>


Essential components in the management
1. Initial management
Resuscitation and ensure temperature stability
Pulse oximetry and supplemental oxygen
Chest radiograph : immediate if significant respiratory distress or delayed until
4 hours if mild respiratory distress
Review history : gestation, rupture of membranes, type of delivery, meconium
stained amniotic fluid, maternal diabetes
If RDS suggested consider intubation and early surfactant and/ or CPAP
Assess for clinical improvement regarding:
Well/ unwell, pink/pale/blue
Perfusion
Signs of respiratory distress
Oxygen saturation


2. Clinical improvement
Observe over 10 - 20 minutes → if quiet tachypnea → consider TTN →
routine neonatal care


3. Consider echocardiography if lung fields in chest radiograph is clear
4. Proceed to further support if any of the following exists:
No clinical improvement
Condition deteriorates


Abnormal chest radiograph
Infant requires greater than 40% oxygen to maintain saturation
5. Establish IV access
Umbilical venous catheter and start IVF 60 ml/kg/day initially 10% dextrose
Consider umbilical arterial catheter for blood pressure monitoring and ABG
analysis if the infant's inspired fraction of oxygen exceeds 40%


6. Blood tests
Blood glucose
CBC with differential
CRP
Blood culture; Not helpful initially as results may take 48 hours
Blood gases
Start IV antibiotic ; Benzylpenicillin ( or Amoxicillin) and Gentamicin
A. Supportive measures
Incubator care in NICU and Respiratory support with frequent monitoring of
vital signs and ABG
Temperature : goal core temperature  or equal to 36.5 - 37 C
Nutrition: Start with glucose 10 % and amino acids (in extremely prematures)
at rate of 65-75 ml /kg; increase gradually over the first week to 150-180 ml/kg
;avoid overhydration that may open ductus arteriosus
Electrolytes added at 2-3rd day
Monitor electrolytes and urine output


Respiratory Support
Keep arterial oxygen pressure between 50 and 70 mm Hg
The currently recommended range of oxygen saturation targets is 91-95%.
1. Ambient /head box /nasal cannula / Vapotherm
If baby looks comfortable with good saturation and good blood gases ( pH
greater than7.25 and PCO2 less than 50 mmHg)
2. Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (nCPAP)
Recruits and prevents collapse of surfactant-deficient alveoli
Early use of CPAP for stabilization of at-risk preterm infants beginning as
early as in the delivery room reduces ventilatory needs
Considered if oxygen saturation cannot be kept greater than 90% at inspired oxygen
concentrations of 40-70% or greater
Another approach is to intubate the preterm infant, administer intratracheal
surfactant and then extubate the infant and begin CPAP
3. Endotracheal intubation ( and Surfactant) and Mechanical Ventilation
Consider for any of the following
Baby unwell, marked recessions
No improvement on CPAP :CPAP of 5-10 cm H2O cannot keep
oxygen saturation greater than 90% while breathing 40-70% oxygen
Infants with respiratory failure
◆ Arterial blood pH less than7.20
◆ Arterial blood PaCO2 greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg
◆ Arterial blood PaO2 of less than 50 mmHg


4. Surfactant
Prophylactic treatment
Indicated for very low birth weight less than 30 weeks


In the first few minutes of life before clinical or radiologic confirmation
of RDS
Rescue treatment
For babies greater than or equal to 30 weeks
Surfactant administered to ventilated infants with clinical and or
radiological signs of RDS


B. Antibiotics
Start antibiotics in all infants who present with respiratory distress at birth after
the sepsis screen has been obtained.
Discontinue antibiotics after 2-5 days if blood cultures are negative and no
maternal risk factors found


Radiographic manifestations of resp distress in premature infants
Mild to moderate RDS
Bilateral, diffuse, reticulo- granular infiltrates (ground - glass appearances)
Air bronchograms represent aerated airways superimposed on a background
of collapsed alveoli
Poor lung expansion (small lungs volumes)
Severe RDS
Opacification of both lungs (White airless lungs)

<summary>Check Answer</summary>

Plasmodium infected anopheles mosquito bites a human and transmit sporozoites
into the bloodstream. Sporozoites migrate through the blood to the liver where they invade hepatocytes and
divide to form multinucleated schizont - pre erythrocytic stage

The schizonts rupture and release merozoites into the circulation where they invade red blood cells within red cells merozoites mature from ring form into trophozoites to
multinucleated schizonts: erythrocytic stage

Some merozoites differentiate into male or female gametocytes. These cells are ingested by the anopheles mosquito and mature in the midgut where sporozoites
develop and migrate to the salivary glands of the mosquito

The mosquito complete the cycle of transmission by biting another host

#### Question 11

What does the term "Cold chain system" mean in vaccine management?
<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
A system of ensuring that the vaccines remain in a potent state from the manufacturer to the
point of use. The main purpose of a cold chain system is to maintain product quality from the
time of manufacture until the point of administration by ensuring that vaccines are stored and
transported within WHO-recommended temperature ranges.
</details>

What is a vaccine vial monitor and how does one interpret the different stages on the
monitor?
<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

A vaccine vial monitor (VVM) is a label containing a heat sensitive material which is
placed on a vaccine vial to register cumulative heat exposure over time. The combined
effects of time and temperature cause the inner square of the VVM to darken, gradually
and irreversibly.

At the starting point, the inner square is a lighter colour than the outer circle. From then on, until the temperature and/or duration of heat reaches a level known to degrade the vaccine
beyond acceptable limits, the inner square remains lighter than the outer circle. 

At the discard point, the inner square is the same colour as the outer circle. This reflects that the vial has been exposed to an unacceptable level of heat and the vaccine degraded beyond
acceptable limits. The inner square will continue to darken with heat exposure until it is much darker than the outer circle. Whenever the inner square matches or is darker than
the outer circle, the vial must be discarded.

Note: vials whose square has begun to change colour should be used first.

pentavalent vaccines.Two vials of vaccine are shaken and compared immediately and 30 minutes after shaking.One vial contains a control (a known frozen sample) while the other
vial contains a test sample.If the test sample sediments faster than the frozen sample, then our test sample should be disposed off.

</details>

Briefly describe the cold chain

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

The system used for storing vaccines in good condition is called the cold chain. It is sometimes referred to as the vaccine supply chain, or the immunization supply chain. The
cold chain consists of a series of links that are designed to keep vaccines within WHO recommended temperature ranges, from the point of manufacture to the point of
administration. The Figure below illustrates the complete cold chain. The bottom row of arrows shows the flow of vaccines down to the health facilities; the top row of arrows shows
where data are collected, recorded, checked and analysed, and how reporting information flows back up the chain. Following this sequence ensures that cold chain performance is
properly monitored and that the necessary information is gathered for vaccine forecasting.

CARDIAC FAILURE
Management of CCF in a 3 year old weighing 15kg
Treat or correct the underlying cause
Treat the precipitating cause - infection, anaemia
Manage the symptoms:
Reducing the preload
Enhancing cardiac contractility
Reducing the afterload
Correcting or removing the underlying cause
Surgical correction of the structural abnormality - eg: patch closure of VSD, surgical
ligation or device embolization of PDA, total correction of TOF
Replacement of a severely damaged valve
Treating the severe hypertension


Treatment of the precipitating events
Rheumatic activity
Infective endocarditis
Intercurrent infections
Anaemia
Electrolyte imbalances
Arrhythmia
Pulmonary embolism
Drug interactions
Drug toxicity or non-compliance
Other system disturbances
Supportive Care - General Measures
Bed rest and limit activities
Nurse in a propped up or in sitting position
Control fever
Expressed breast milk for small infants
Fluid restriction in volume overload (edematous)
Optimal sedation- Morphine SC in severe excitation
Correction of anemia - Iron supplementation, blood transfusion
Acidosis, hypoglycemia and hypocalcemia if present
Oxygen - caution in LT-RT shunt as pulmonary vasodilation may increase shunt
CPAP or mechanical ventilation as necessary
Principles of Treatment - Supportive Care
Physical activities: competitive and strenuous sports activities are usually
contraindicated
Nutritional support: enhanced caloric content feedings and nasogastric or
gastrostomy feedings may be necessary to maintain the patient’s growth


Salt
Infants with CHF require 120-150 Kcal/kg/day of caloric intake and 2-3 mEq/kg/day of
sodium
Sodium restriction is not recommended in infants and young children
Sodium restriction can result in impaired body and brain growth
Regular monitoring of urea and electrolytes recommended
Chronic Heart Failure
Reduce preload- Furosemide (Lasix) IV: 0.5-2 mg/kg/dose PO: 1-4 mg/kg/day,
divided twice to 4 times daily (reduce the fluid), Spironolactone (Aldactone) PO: 1-3
mg/kg/day, divided bid or tid
Inotropic agents eg. Digoxin dose 0.04 - 0.06 mg/kg. Digitalising dose 1⁄2 the total
dose, then 1⁄4 total dose after 8hrs then 1⁄4 daily (improving contractility)
Rate reduction - beta blockers carvedilol and metoprolol (reduce the heart rate)
Vasodilators - Used if blood pressure allows and in absence of obstructive lesions


Afterload reducers
Cardiac remodeling
Commonly used drugs
◆ Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors e.g. Captopril,
Enalapril
◆ Angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]


INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS
Etiology
Streptococcus viridans (50%): Follows dental surgery ,dental caries, tonsillectomy,
dental extraction
Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis: Mainly postoperative, Risk is high with
prosthetic valve and central venous catheter
Group D enterococci: More often after lower bowel or genitourinary procedures
HACEK group : Haemophilus, Actinobacillus, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, and
Kingella species
Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Serratia marcescens: Seen more frequent in
intravenous drug users
Fungal: Seen more frequent in immunodeficient & post open heart surgery.
Pathogenesis
Infection of the valvular & mural endocardium
Infection can be bacterial, viral, or fungal


Two factors are essential
Presence of cardiac structural abnormality with significant pressure gradient
Bacteremia; even transient
Implantation of the organism in the diseased endocardium → Local inflammation &
formation of friable vegetations composed of platelets, fibrin, inflammatory cells, and
organisms
They heal with fibrosis and calcification of the area compromising valvular and
myocardial function
Investigations
For diagnosis
Blood culture
3-5 blood samples before the start of antibiotic
The causative agent is recovered from the 1st 2 blood cultures in 90% of
cases


Echocardiography: transthoracic and transesophageal
Detects vegetations
May predict embolization
Detects underlying cardiac lesions
Detects complication e.g. valve dysfunction or leak , myocardial abscess
Culture of other specimens may include scrapings from skin lesions, urine, synovial
fluid, abscesses, and, CSF in case of meningitis
With unusual microorganisms
PCR of surgical material e.g. resected valve tissues
Specific serology


For monitoring/effect
Acute phase reactant (ESR, CRP, Procalcitonin and Leukocytosis)
Complete blood count: for anemia of chronic illness
Renal function tests, urinalysis - microscopic hematuria
Prevention
Oral and dental care
Antibiotic prophylaxis: required with;
Prosthetic cardiac valve or prosthetic material used for cardiac valve repair
Previous infective endocarditis
Repaired Congenital heart disease with prosthetic material or device
Palliative shunts and conduits
Congenital heart disease (except ASD)
Permanently damaged valves due to Rheumatic heart disease


Procedures requiring prophylaxis
Dental /oral
Invasive respiratory tract procedures
Cardiac surgery/catheterization
Treatment
Prophylactic antibiotics
Oral amoxicillin (50 mg/kg) or Ampicillin Or
Ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg) IM or IV Or
If penicillin allergic: Azithromycin or clindamycin
Vigorous treatment of sepsis and local infections


Medical
Hospitalization, Bed rest and treat heart failure
Antibiotic therapy
Start immediate parenteral antibiotic combinations while waiting for culture
results.
For 4-6 weeks (modify in view of clinical and laboratory response)
Best empirical therapy in patients without a prosthetic valve is vancomycin
plus gentamicin
Other antibiotics include crystalline penicillin G, ceftriaxone, nafcillin or
oxacillin.
Amphotericin B and 5 fluorocytosine for fungal endocarditis.


Surgical
Removal of vegetation with or without valve replacement
Indications
Treatment failure e.g. increasing size of vegetations while under therapy
Complications: Severe valve involvement with intractable heart failure,
myocardial abscess, recurrent emboli


Clinical presentation of child with subacute bacterial endocarditis
History: Suggestive of a risk factor or bacteremia

RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE
Discuss the management of 10 year old with RHD and in a large mitral incompetence
who presents with CCF
Eradicate group A Streptococci from the upper respiratory tract
Oral penicillin or erythromycin for 10 days or a single intramuscular injection of
benzathine penicillin
Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis after this initial course of antibiotic therapy
Typical migratory Arthritis
Bed rest for 2 weeks
Anti-inflammatory drug: Salicylates
Dose: 50-70 mg/kg/day (max  or equal to 6 gram /day) For 3-5 days
Then 50 mg/kg/d for 3 weeks.
Then gradual withdrawal monitored by decline in ESR & CRP
Side effects: Gastritis, GI bleeding (R/Gastroprotection), Reye syndrome
Daily examination is vital to pick carditis that can present within 2 weeks of the onset


Carditis
Bed rest and restrict physical activity
For cases with severe carditis and heart failure
Rest for 3 months and gradual ambulation for a similar period
Anti-inflammatory drugs
1. Corticosteroids (Prednisone)
Moderate to severe carditis (with cardiomegaly)
Heart failure.
Dose- 2 mg/kg/d for 2-3 weeks, Followed by half the dose for 2-3 wk,
And then tapering of the dose by 5 mg/24 hr every 2-3 days
At the beginning of tapering; salicylates are started at a dose of 50

RICKETS
Describe the metabolism of endogenous vitamin D
There’s two forms of vitamin D
D2 ergocalciferol - plant origin.
D3 cholecalciferol - animal origin
These Vit D are absorbed from the upper small intestine with aid of bile salts
Ultra violet rays convert 7- Dehydrocholesterol in the skin to vitamin D3
In the liver: Vitamin D3 is converted to 25 (OH) D3 by 25 hydroxylase enzymes.
If Low serum calcium or phosphate, High parathyroid hormone level
1 alpha hydroxylase enzyme is activated
Converts 25 (OH) D3 → 1, 25 (OH)2 D3 (Active form)
If Normal or high serum calcium
24 hydroxylase enzyme is activated
Converts 25 (OH) D3 → 24, 25 (OH)2 D3 (Inactive form)
Functions: Via synthesis of transport protein
Enhance Ca, phosphate deposition in bones.
Increase Renal reabsorption of calcium & phosphate


Increase Intestinal absorption of calcium & phosphate


Causes
Calcium deficiency with 2ry hyperparathyroidism
Nutritional vitamin D deficiency (Infantile rickets)
Secondary vitamin D deficiency due to:
Malabsorption syndromes (Celiac rickets).
Decreased liver 25-hydroxylase activity in chronic liver disease
Increased degradation e.g. with anti epileptic drugs.
Rickets with chronic renal failure (Renal osteodystrophy)
Vitamin D dependent rickets type I
Vitamin D dependent rickets type II
Calcium deficiency: nutritional, malabsorption or in premature infant
Phosphate deficiency without 2ry hyperparathyroidism
Decreased phosphate intake
Premature infants (rickets of prematurity)
Renal phosphate losses e.g.
Familial hypophosphatemia.
Fanconi syndromes
Overproduction of phosphatonin e.g. Tumor-induced rickets


Other conditions that can cause rickets
Medications
Antacids
Anticonvulsants
Corticosteroids
Loop diuretics
Malignancy
Prematurity
Diseases of organs associated with vitamin D and calcium metabolism
Kidney disease
Liver and biliary tract disease
Malabsorption syndromes
Celiac disease
Cystic fibrosis (rare)


Radiological features of rickets
X-ray at lower ends of long bones especially wrist due to easy access , rapid growth and soft
tissue around is thin
Active rickets
The lower ends show
Broadening ; widening of the distal end of the metaphysis (Splaying)
Cupping or concavity ; metaphysis changes from a convex or flat surface to a
more concave surface
Metaphysis loses its sharp border (Fraying )
Wide joint space
The shaft shows
Rarefaction → reduced bone density
Maybe a greenstick fracture.
May be deformities


Healing rickets
Usually seen 2 weeks of vitamin D therapy
The lower ends shows white concave continuous line at ZPC
Less evident features of rickets
Healed rickets
Usually seen 4 - 6 weeks of vitamin D therapy
The lower ends show a straight continuous line at ZPC.
No features of active rickets.

Oxygen saturation less than90%
Central cyanosis
Inability to drink or breast feed
AVPU less than A
Inability to talk or complete sentences
Tachycardia
Admit
Oxygen: nasal prongs at 1-2l/min which provides 30-35% oxygen
Nebulize with 2.5mg salbutamol or 6 puffs of inhaler with spacer and mask.

Long term management of asthma
Step 1
• Low dose ICS whenever SABA taken (indirect evidence), or daily low dose ICS
Step 2
Preferred controller is daily low dose ICS
Other controller options include as-needed low dose ICS taken whenever SABA is
taken, but only one study in children
Studies of as-needed ICS-formoterol are needed; maintenance and reliever therapy
with low dose budesonide-formoterol in children 4-11 years reduced exacerbations by
70-79% compared with ICS and ICS-LABA
Step 3
Low dose ICS-LABA and medium dose ICS are ‘preferred’ controller treatments
No safety signal with ICS-LABA in children 4-11 years
Step 4
Medium dose ICS-LABA, but refer for expert advice
Avoid exposure to triggering agents
Eliminate or reduce problematic environmental exposures
Avoid drugs, foods, and additives known to cause symptoms.
Avoid allergens as suggested by skin testing

TUBERCULOSIS


Short notes on mantoux testing
Detects delayed hypersensitivity reaction to tuberculoprotein
Mantoux test: intradermal injection of 0.1 ml containing 5 tuberculin units of purified
protein derivative (PPD) should create a wheal
Interpretation: measure the widest induration after 48 -72 hours
Positive test ( or equal to TB infection or disease)
Induration greater than5 mm2 in high risk patients;
Close contact with active tuberculosis patient
Immunodeficiency- malnourished or HIV negative
Child having clinical or chest x ray compatible with tuberculosis
Induration greater than10 mm2 in moderate risk patients;
Child less than 4 years
Child from endemic area or exposed to people from endemic area
Chronic diseases with increased risk e.g. diabetes , renal diseases
Induration greater than15 mm2 in any child above 4 years without risk factors
False positive test; usually less than 10 mm induration, consider:
Recent BCG vaccination; reactivity is lost by 5-10 years after vaccine
Non tuberculous mycobacteria
Negative test: induration less than 5 mm2
True negative test → no T.B infection
False negative test → in
Technical error
Transient suppression of tuberculin reactivity with viral infections e.g.
measles, mumps or live virus immunization
Early in the disease
Miliary TB
Immunodeficiency
Outline pathogenesis
Primary exposure to T.B bacilli result in formation of primary complex at the site of
entry of the bacilli (the commonest form in children).
Primary pulmonary complex: Composed of
Primary focus (Ghon’s focus)
Lymphangitis
Hilar lymphadenitis
Each primary focus is formed of tubercles, each tubercle is formed of :
Central caseation
Epithelioid cells
Macrophages and lymphocytes
Langerhans giant cells


With good immunity
Regression (in 90%)
Small focus → complete fibrosis
Large focus → capsulation & calcification → In which T.B bacilli may remain viable for
years ;Latent TB Infection ( LTBI)


With poor immunity


Progression
Risk for progression of latent TB: Infants and children greater than or equal to4yr of age, especially those
less than2 yr of age, Adolescents and young adults, immunocompromised, and infection with
measles and pertussis.
Primary Cavitation
Direct spread → T.B pneumonia, Tuberculous effusion
Bronchial spread (Endobronchial T.B) - Incomplete obstruction →
emphysema and Complete obstruction → collapse
Hematologic spread → One organ T.B, Miliary T.B

Outline interventions which have proved useful in reducing mortality due to childhood
pneumonia
Below
Outline the critical strategies for the management and control of pneumonia (primary,
secondary, tertiary)
Below
Cardinal features in a 4 year old
Onset is variable from acute, sub-acute or gradual
General:
Fever, malaise , toxemia (worst in bronchopneumonia)
May be abdominal pain: Referred from lower lobe pneumonia
Chest
Cough (dry then productive)
Dyspnea and grunting
Signs of respiratory distress:
Tachypnea is the most consistent clinical manifestation of pneumonia, nasal
flaring, retractions and grunting
Cyanosis and lethargy in severe infection especially in infants


Management of pneumonia in outpatient
Oral amoxicillin: 40-45mg/kg/dose
Counsel carefully on danger signs and need to return if these develop
All children must be reviewed within 48 hours if review is not possible then admit
children with in drawing
Management of severe pneumonia in the wards


Admit
Oxygen
Injectable penicillin: 250000 IU 6 hourly (50,000 IU/ kg 6 hourly)
Gentamicin: 30 mg/kg once daily (7.5 mg/kg OD)
Both IM/ IV for at least 5 days.
Fatma, a 4 month old girl (5kg) is brought to the pediatric outpatient clinic by her
mother with complaints of cough, hotness of body and difficulty in breathing for three
days. You observe that she is alert lying in the mother’s arms breastfeeding. On a
rapid assessment you note that she has no noisy breathing. She is breathing at a rate
of 63 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation on room air is at 89%, has no grunting, no
head nodding and no central cyanosis. Lower chest wall indrawing is present but
there is no deep acidotic breathing. Crepitations are heard bilaterally on auscultation.
Rhonchi (wheezes) are absent.
a) What would you do at this point?
Ensure my safety ( sanitize hands,wear gloves, put on a mask).
Change the setting because the patient has a decreased level of consciousness
( AVPU less than A at V)
Assess airway and breathing then administer oxygen via nasal prongs at 0.5-1L/ min
because she is hypoxaemic ( SP02 is 89% on room air) which delivers 30-35%
oxygen
Assess circulation and do an RBS, administer 5ml/kg of 10% dextrose over 2-3 min if
glucose is less than 2.5mmol/L.
b) No other issues are identified in your rapid assessment. What would your working
diagnosis be at this point and why? Give the appropriate classification and justify.
Pneumonia: because of acute cough, fever, difficulty in breathing for 3 days and
examination findings of tachypnea, hypoxemia, lower chest wall indrawing and
bilateral crepitations (indicating consolidation) and is alert and able to breastfeed and
has no grunting, head nodding or central cyanosis.
Classification: Severe pneumonia because of presence of hypoxaemia (89 %)

ACUTE POISONING


Define
Acute poisoning is exposure to a poison on one occasion or during a short period of time.
Symptoms develop in close relation to the degree of exposure.
Eg. unintentional ingestions by toddlers, suicide attempts by adolescents
Poisoning may be suicidal, accidental or homicidal
Incidence of poisoning is attributed to widespread use and free availability of
insecticides, pesticides and other harmful chemicals for use in agriculture & industries
In order of frequency, the toxic agents include organophosphorus compounds,
barbiturates, benzodiazepines, vegetable poisons, phenothiazines, corrosive acids
etc

and deoxynucleotidyl transferase
ALL  or equal to negative MPO and positive TdT
Cytogenetics and molecular studies - mutation analysis and gene expression studies
Immunophenotyping (flow cytometry) - confirms lymphoid lineage or myeloid lineage,
demonstrates B cell antigens and T cell antigens and can distinguish which parents
are eligible for certain therapies eg. Rituximab for cd20 positive cells
Complete blood count - increased white blood cells, Normocytic normochromic cells
and circulating lymphoblasts
Management
Supportive:
Analgesics for pain
Neupogen (G-CSF growth factors)- reduces incidence of neutropenia
Antibiotic prophylaxis using penicillin, 3rd generation Cephalosporins for febrile
patients and Antifungals if persistent fever greater than3-5 days
Allopurinol for tumor lysis syndrome
Blood products transfusion for anemia and thrombocytopenia using packed RBCs or
Platelet concentrate, fluids and nutrition
Definitive:
Induction (4 weeks)
Vincristine, Doxorubicin, Prednisone, Methotrexate Intra-thecal (MXT IT)
Bone marrow aspirate day 30: for assessment of remission
In the meantime, start consolidation and for those not in remissions consider
giving at least three consolidations


Consolidation
Starts 10-14 days after completing induction
Cyclophosphamide - Day 1 and 8; Vincristine - Day 1 and 8 ; Cytarabine -
Days 1-4, 22-25, 29-32
Cranial Radiotherapy (DXT) given to patients starting 7-14 days after

term disease-free survival in about two thirds of patients


Stem cell transplantation
For patients with favorable prognostic features and improved outcome with
chemotherapy, matched sibling stem cell transplantation is recommended
only after a relapse


Matched unrelated donor stem cell transplants may be effective therapy,
Matched unrelated donor transplants are usually reserved for patients who
have a relapse.

Decide what to do
Stunting
Low Length / Height for age: is an indicator for chronic malnutrition
Caused by:
prolonged food
deprivation/chronic illness
low SES
poor maternal health/ frequent illness
inappropriate infant /young child feeding and care in
early life


Wasting
Low Weight for height: is an indicator for acute malnutrition
Low MUAC measurement (6 to 59 months)
Caused by: Recent lack of food/ acute illness
Implications of malnutrition on child health
Under-nutrition reduces immunological capacity to defend against diseases, and
recurrent infections, in turn reduce and deprive the body from essential nutrients. This
leads to the dismal growth of children which adversely affects a child's mental and
physical development and learning capacity in future life.
Undernutrition, which is an important determinant of maternal and child health, has
significant negative effects on brain and cognitive development of children.
Malnutrition prevents children from reaching their full physical and mental potential.
Health and physical consequences of prolonged states of malnourishment among
children are: delay in their physical growth and motor development; lower intellectual
quotient (IQ), greater behavioural problems and deficient social skills; susceptibility to
contracting diseases
Children exposed to severe acute malnutrition in early life have poor cognitive
function, poor school achievement and behavioural problems.

MALNUTRITION
List common micronutrient deficiencies in KENYA
Iron
Vitamin A
Zinc
Folate
Iodine (in salts)


Discuss short and long term measure taken
Dietary diversification
Food fortification
Micronutrient supplementation
Disease prevention measures such as parasitic infection control, water, sanitation
and hygiene (WASH)
Health education and Counselling.
Food fortification is a valuable public health strategy to help fill nutrient gaps in diets
and control micronutrient deficiencies. The Government of Kenya adopted food
fortification as an efficient, long-term means of facilitating adequate micronutrient
intake.
Strategies that address a higher intake of iron and zinc may include better access to


flesh food and promote preparation practices that increase the bioavailability of non-
heme iron and zinc. To address the low intake of vitamin A and vitamin B12,


interventions should include more meat, fish, dark green leafy vegetables, and other
vegetables and fruits rich in provitamin A.
Define failure to thrive
A term used to describe inadequate growth or the inability to maintain growth, usually
in early childhood. It is a sign of undernutrition

polyunsaturated fats that (docosahexaenoic acid -DHA & arachidonic acid-ARA) not
found in other milk. DHA is an omega-3 fatty acid that is a primary structural
component of the human brain, cerebral cortex, skin, and retina
It promotes growth of a protective bacteria in the gut that protects against invasion of
harmful bacteria and growth of harmful bacteria in the GI (lactoferrin &lysosome)
Rich in antibodies and may provide protection against bacteria in the birth canal and
those associated with other human contact therefore. Reduces risk of acute illness
and chronic illnesses. reduction in admissions due to diarrhea, pneumonia

SICKLE CELL ANEMIA
Explain why sickle cell disease children don't get symptoms until 6 months?
The reason that infants don't show symptoms at birth is because of fetal hemoglobin
protects the red blood cells from sickling. When the infant is around 4 to 5 months of
age, the fetal hemoglobin is replaced by sickle hemoglobin and the cells begin to
sickle. SCD is a disease that worsens over time.
Classical signs of sickle cell disease infants
Anemia. This is the most common symptom. Having fewer red blood cells causes
anemia. Anemia can make a child pale and tired.


Yellowing of the skin, eyes, and mouth (jaundice). This is a common symptom. Sickle
cells don't live as long as normal red blood cells. They die faster than the liver can
filter them out. The yellow color is caused by a substance (bilirubin) that is released
when the red blood cells die.
Irritability, refusal to feed

List investigations that would be necessary for screening Mutiso's condition. Include
the expected findings
FHG- normal platelet count
APTT- prolonged
INR- normal
Bleeding time- normal
Thrombin time- normal
Von Willebrand Factor- normal
Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation-normal
Factor VIII/ Factor IX assay - Low in Haemophilia A and B respectively
What test would give a definitive diagnosis?
Factor VIII or IX assay
Draw and describe the traditional coagulation cascade
HK High molecular weight kininogen
PK Prekallikrein
PL Phospholipid
TH Thrombin
The intrinsic pathway is initiated by the exposure of blood to a negatively charged
surface (such as celite, kaolin, silica) in the in vitro activated partial thromboplastin
clotting time (aPTT)
The extrinsic pathway is activated by tissue factor exposed at the site of injury or
tissue factor-like material ( thromboplastin,TPL) in the in vitro prothrombin clotting
time.
Both pathways converge on the activation of factor X which, as a component of
prothrombinase, converts prothrombin to thrombin, the final enzyme of the clotting
cascade.
Thrombin converts fibrinogen from a soluble plasma protein into an insoluble fibrin
clot.

CHILD HEALTH


List and briefly explain strategies in preventing pneumonia


Several children admitted with fever, maculopapular rash and resp symptoms. Outline
essential components of the necessary response
Essential components of case investigation include establishing a diagnosis of
measles- An essential first step in a measles case investigation is to obtain necessary
clinical information to determine whether or not a reported case is clinically
compatible with measles and to obtain key epidemiological information.
Obtaining immunization histories for confirmed cases- Document all doses of
measles-containing vaccine. Acceptable proof of vaccination is documented
administration of live measles virus-containing vaccine.
Identifying sources of infection- Case-patients or their caregivers should be asked
about contact with other known cases. When no history of contact with a known case
can be found, opportunities for exposure to unknown cases should be sought.
Assessing potential for transmission and identifying contacts without presumptive
evidence of immunity- In the event of a confirmed measles case, local or state health
departments should contact health care providers in their areas through the media to
inform them of the confirmed case and request immediate reporting of any suspected
cases.
Classifying importation status
Obtaining specimens for genotyping
Tracking what information is collected and what still needs to be collected. Tracking is
easily accomplished by constructing a line listing of cases, allowing ready
identification of known and unknown data and ensuring complete case investigation.
Identifying risk of transmission in the population affected by the outbreak. As part of
the case investigation, the potential for further transmission should be evaluated, and
an assessment should be made of exposed contacts of the case-patient

beyond the upper limit. Describe the first steps in the management of this child
The patient is admitted
Call for help and change the setting for the child
Assess airway, breathing and circulation and correct any complications. Give oxygen.
Two IV cannulas are inserted. Take blood samples for investigations and GXM.
First cannula, give a bolus of 10ml/kg of normal saline over one hour. The bolus can
be repeated if not out of shock
Administer maintenance fluids calculated based on weight plus addition deficit given
over 48 hours(100ml/kg- 10% loss) half is given in the first 24 hours and shouldn't be
double the normal maintenance
Patient is reassessed and levels of potassium are obtained. Administer potassium
chloride at 20 meq for every 500ml of fluid given. If urine is passed but no potassium
levels available, give half of that. Potassium levels are monitored every 4 hours as
well as glucosuria and ketonuria. Glucose levels are assessed hourly.
Second cannula, give regular insulin iv at 0.03-0.05 iu/kg/hr concurrently with the
fluids. Once glucose drops to 17 mmol/l add 5% dextrose to the normal saline and
monitor till levels of glucose drops and ketones are trace or none in urine then
change to subcutaneous insulin during the next meal.

MORTALITY
Describe the strategies of reducing infant and childhood morbidity and mortality in a
community


Preventing Birth Defect
To reduce the risk of certain birth defects, taking folic acid before and during
pregnancy to prevent neural tube defects,
Addressing Preterm Birth, Low Birth Weight, and Their Outcomes:
Causes can include a mother’s chronic health condition or poor nutrition. Adequate
prenatal care is essential to ensuring that full-term infants are born at a healthy
weight.
Preterm infants are at high risk for serious breathing problems as a result of their
underdeveloped lungs. Treatments such as ventilators and steroids can help stabilize
breathing to allow the lungs to develop more fully.
Getting Pre-Pregnancy and Prenatal Care
Taking good care of her own health before and during pregnancy, a mother can
reduce her baby’s risk of many of the leading causes of infant mortality including birth
defects, preterm birth, low birth weight, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), and
certain pregnancy complications
Reaching a healthy weight, getting proper nutrition, managing chronic health
conditions, and seeking help for substance use and abuse, for example, can help a
woman achieve better health before she is pregnant.
Once she becomes pregnant, a mother should receive early and regular prenatal
care. This type of care helps promote the best outcomes for mother and baby.
Creating a Safe Infant Sleep Environment


Ways to reduce the risk of SIDS and other sleep-related causes of infant death. For
example, always placing a baby on his or her back to sleep and keeping the baby's
sleep area free of soft objects, toys, crib bumpers, and loose bedding are important
ways to reduce a baby’s risk.
Using Newborn Screening to Detect Hidden Conditions
It can detect certain conditions that are not noticeable at the time of birth, but that can
cause serious disability or even death if not treated quickly. Infants with these
conditions may seem perfectly healthy and frequently come from families with no
previous history of a condition.
To perform this screening, health care providers take a few drops of blood from an
infant’s heel and apply them to special paper. The blood spots are then analyzed. If
any conditions are detected, treatment can begin immediately.
