d. Discuss the preventive strategies for this patient and their family during outpatient follow up(12 marks)

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
  <p>Keeping warm</p>
  <p>Hydration</p>
  <p>
    Penicillin prophylaxis: Patients with SCD are prone to infection
    and death from encapsulated bacterial organisms like Streptococcal
    pneumoniae due to splenic dysfunction that occurs within the first
    5 years of life. It is therefore recommended that children with
    SCD should have penicillin prophylaxis started within 2 months of
    life and continued until 5 years of age. However, for patients who
    have had surgical splenectomy, it is given for life. Its use may
    be continued until later in life for children who have had more
    than two episodes of severe pneumonia. The dose of:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Children less than 3 years: Penicillin V syrup 125mg twice
        daily
      </li>
      <li>
        Children more than 3 years: Penicillin V syrup/tablets 250mg
        twice daily
      </li>
      <li>
        Patients with penicillin hypersensitivity may use erythromycin
        as an alternative
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Immunization practices:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (Pneumo-23): At 2 years
        and once every 5years
      </li>
      <li>Influenza vaccine: Annually</li>
      <li>
        Meningococcal vaccine: 2 doses for those below 2 years of age
        and one dose for those above 2years
      </li>
      <li>Hemophilus influenza type B: Booster at 18months</li>
      <li>Neisseria meningitidis</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Hydroxyurea use: It reduces painful crisis, blood transfusion and
    infection in patients with SCD.{' '}
  </p>
  <p>
    Chronic Transfusion Therapy: The aim of chronic transfusion
    therapy is to keep the HbS level less than 30%. Indicated in
    primary stroke prevention, recurrent acute chest syndrome,
    pulmonary htn, leg ulcers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pain management using analgesics like PCM, NSAIDS, or morphine.
    Mild pain management using hot packs, reassurance, reposition &
    massage.
  </p>
  <p>
    Psychosocial Support: Patients go through periods of pain,
    requirements for inpatient care with separation from their
    families or daily activities, physiological changes in their
    bodies due to the chronic hemolysis and the potential threat of
    SCD complications. Parents experience guilt of having passed the
    sickle cell gene to their child, challenges of watching their
    children experience the complications of SCD like pain,
    absenteeism from work as they regularly seek health care for their
    children and the financial drain of the disease. Adults with SCD
    sometimes also experience stigma when choosing marital partners
    and when making career choices. This necessitates that patients
    and their families are offered psychosocial support within the
    healthcare system or as part of patient support groups.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nutritional Support: SCD patients should eat diets with healthy
    nutritious foods just like other normal children. Parents should
    be encouraged to give their children plenty of water or fluids.
    Folic acid supplementation is necessary due to its increased
    demand from the chronic hemolysis
  </p>
  <p>
    Malaria Prophylaxis: SCD patients are susceptible to malaria
    infection which may have serious consequences. It is recommended
    that for patients living in high transmission malaria areas or
    non-immune individuals that prophylactic antimalarial drugs are
    used in addition to the general precautions (e.g. use of
    insecticide treated mosquito nets and environmental measures).
    Patients living in low malarial transmission zones do not require
    prophylaxis. Drugs that can be used for prophylaxis are proguanil
    or mefloquine.
  </p>
  <p>
    Routine Clinic Follow Ups: Patients with SCD require to be
    reviewed regularly at least once every 8-12 weeks. The following
    algorithms can be used for the first and subsequent clinic visits.

Describe the pathogenesis of acute glomerulonephritis


<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>


Streptococcal infection produces antibodies which makes an immune complex with antigen and complement C3. They deposit in the glomerular basement membrane forming subepithelial humps. This leads to acute inflammation which eventually leads to proliferation of mesangial and endothelial cells and glomerular endothelial damage. There is obstruction of glomerular capillaries which reduce glomerular blood flow and GFR leading oliguria, fluid retention, hypovolemia and edema. This also activates the juxtaglomerular apparatus and the RAAS system leading hypertension. There is also hematuria and proteinuria.

#### Question 14

You receive a 4kg newborn aged 2hours who is reported to be a term baby, born after prolonged 2nd stage of labour due to cephalo-pelvic disproportion.

What is the likely diagnosis?
<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
Perinatal asphyxia
</details>


Discuss briefly the pathophysiology from initial insult to onset of convulsions

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
Hypoxic ischemic insult leads to reduced oxygen and depletion of glucose. This reduces ATP which causes anaerobic metabolism leading to failure of the ATP
dependant sodium potassium pump which leads to neuronal membrane
depolarization because of the increased intracellular sodium, calcium and
extracellular glutamate levels. Synaptic cleft floods with glutamate which activates NMDA and AMPA receptors, this leads to a calcium influx into the cell which increases intracellular calcium levels and excitatory amino acid levels. This activates nitric oxide synthase, which causes neurotoxicity and inflammation and leads to cell edema due to influx of water intracellularly. Eventually there is mitochondrial disruption, release of O3 and reduced glutathione. Primary energy failure (minutes )leads to cell death and early necrosis. Partial recovery of oxidative metabolism and acidosis leads to reperfusion which partially reduces excitatory amino acids and edema. Secondary energy failure (hours to days) is characterized by cell death and late
apoptosis. Finally there is chronic brain injury (weeks to months), delayed cerebral atrophy and cell loss. There is reduced cell metabolism resulting in cytotoxic edema, seizures, raised cytokine levels and mitochondrial failure

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
Lungs: Manifested by: Progressive signs of respiratory distress are noted soon after birth and include

Tachypnea (greater than 60 / min) & working alae nasi

Intercostal & subcostal retractions

Expiratory grunting (from partial closure of glottis)

Central cyanosis, disturbed consciousness

Extremely immature neonates may develop apnea and/or irregular respirations

Patients may also have edema, ileus, and oliguria due to: reduced surfactant → increases alveolar surface tension → diffuse
alveolar collapse (atelectasis) during expiration → higher pressure required to
inflate lung → increased work of breathing with impaired gas exchange →
hypoxemia, hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis

CNS failure: Manifested by: Slow, irregular, gasping respiration. 

Apneic attacks.

Disturbed consciousness. Poor reflexes Due to: Over sedation, Perinatal asphyxia, Intracranial hemorrhage
</details>


Describe the essential components in the management
<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

Initial management

Resuscitation and ensure temperature stability

Pulse oximetry and supplemental oxygen

Chest radiograph : immediate if significant respiratory distress or delayed until 4 hours if mild respiratory distress

Review history : gestation, rupture of membranes, type of delivery, meconium stained amniotic fluid, maternal diabetes

If RDS suggested consider intubation and early surfactant and/ or CPAP

Assess for clinical improvement regarding:

Well/ unwell, pink/pale/blue

Perfusion

Signs of respiratory distress

Oxygen saturation

2. Clinical improvement

Observe over 10 - 20 minutes → if quiet tachypnea → consider TTN → routine neonatal care

3. Consider echocardiography if lung fields in chest radiograph is clear

4. Proceed to further support if any of the following exists: No clinical improvement, Condition deteriorates

Abnormal chest radiograph

Infant requires greater than 40% oxygen to maintain saturation

5. Establish IV access

Umbilical venous catheter and start IVF 60 ml/kg/day initially 10% dextrose

Consider umbilical arterial catheter for blood pressure monitoring and ABG analysis if the infant's inspired fraction of oxygen exceeds 40%

6. Blood tests

Blood glucose

CBC with differential

CRP

Blood culture; Not helpful initially as results may take 48 hours

Blood gases

Start IV antibiotic ; Benzylpenicillin ( or Amoxicillin) and Gentamicin

A. Supportive measures

Incubator care in NICU and Respiratory support with frequent monitoring of vital signs and ABG

Temperature : goal core temperature  or equal to 36.5 - 37 C

Nutrition: Start with glucose 10 % and amino acids (in extremely prematures) at rate of 65-75 ml /kg; increase gradually over the first week to 150-180 ml/kg;avoid overhydration that may open ductus arteriosus

Electrolytes added at 2-3rd day

Monitor electrolytes and urine output

Respiratory Support

Keep arterial oxygen pressure between 50 and 70 mm Hg

The currently recommended range of oxygen saturation targets is 91-95%.

1. Ambient /head box /nasal cannula / Vapotherm

If baby looks comfortable with good saturation and good blood gases ( pH greater than7.25 and PCO2 less than 50 mmHg)

2. Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (nCPAP)

Recruits and prevents collapse of surfactant-deficient alveoli

Early use of CPAP for stabilization of at-risk preterm infants beginning as early as in the delivery room reduces ventilatory needs

Considered if oxygen saturation cannot be kept greater than 90% at inspired oxygen concentrations of 40-70% or greater

Another approach is to intubate the preterm infant, administer intratracheal surfactant and then extubate the infant and begin CPAP

3. Endotracheal intubation ( and Surfactant) and Mechanical Ventilation

Consider for any of the following

Baby unwell, marked recessions

No improvement on CPAP :CPAP of 5-10 cm H2O cannot keep oxygen saturation greater than 90% while breathing 40-70% oxygen

Infants with respiratory failure

Arterial blood pH less than7.20

Arterial blood PaCO2 greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg

Arterial blood PaO2 of less than 50 mmHg


4. Surfactant

Prophylactic treatment

Indicated for very low birth weight less than 30 weeks


In the first few minutes of life before clinical or radiologic confirmation of RDS

Rescue treatment

For babies greater than or equal to 30 weeks

Surfactant administered to ventilated infants with clinical and or radiological signs of RDS


B. Antibiotics

Start antibiotics in all infants who present with respiratory distress at birth after the sepsis screen has been obtained.

Discontinue antibiotics after 2-5 days if blood cultures are negative and no maternal risk factors found

    skin, dilated pupils(mydriasis) and tachycardia. Atropine as IV
    infusion after atropinization. Continued for at least 24 hours
    until organophosphate is metabolized. Atropine does not bind to
    nicotinic receptors hence ineffective in treating neuromuscular
    dysfunction.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pralidoxime & other oximes (Obidoxime). Acts by regenerating
    acetylcholinesterase by dephosphorylation. Function peripherally
    on both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. Should only be
    administered after atropine due to risk of transient worsening of
    acetylcholinesterase inhibition.
  </p>
  <p>
    Benzodiazepines. To control organophosphate-induced seizures. Acts

Plasmodium infected anopheles mosquito bites a human and transmit sporozoites
into the bloodstream. Sporozoites migrate through the blood to the liver where they invade hepatocytes and
divide to form multinucleated schizont - pre erythrocytic stage

The schizonts rupture and release merozoites into the circulation where they invade red blood cells within red cells merozoites mature from ring form into trophozoites to
multinucleated schizonts: erythrocytic stage

Some merozoites differentiate into male or female gametocytes. These cells are ingested by the anopheles mosquito and mature in the midgut where sporozoites
develop and migrate to the salivary glands of the mosquito

The mosquito complete the cycle of transmission by biting another host

#### Question 28

What does the term "Cold chain system" mean in vaccine management?
<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
A system of ensuring that the vaccines remain in a potent state from the manufacturer to the
point of use. The main purpose of a cold chain system is to maintain product quality from the
time of manufacture until the point of administration by ensuring that vaccines are stored and
transported within WHO-recommended temperature ranges.
</details>

What is a vaccine vial monitor and how does one interpret the different stages on the
monitor?
<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

A vaccine vial monitor (VVM) is a label containing a heat sensitive material which is
placed on a vaccine vial to register cumulative heat exposure over time. The combined
effects of time and temperature cause the inner square of the VVM to darken, gradually
and irreversibly.

At the starting point, the inner square is a lighter colour than the outer circle. From then on, until the temperature and/or duration of heat reaches a level known to degrade the vaccine
beyond acceptable limits, the inner square remains lighter than the outer circle. 

At the discard point, the inner square is the same colour as the outer circle. This reflects that the vial has been exposed to an unacceptable level of heat and the vaccine degraded beyond
acceptable limits. The inner square will continue to darken with heat exposure until it is much darker than the outer circle. Whenever the inner square matches or is darker than
the outer circle, the vial must be discarded.

Note: vials whose square has begun to change colour should be used first.

pentavalent vaccines.Two vials of vaccine are shaken and compared immediately and 30 minutes after shaking.One vial contains a control (a known frozen sample) while the other
vial contains a test sample.If the test sample sediments faster than the frozen sample, then our test sample should be disposed off.

</details>

Briefly describe the cold chain

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

The system used for storing vaccines in good condition is called the cold chain. It is sometimes referred to as the vaccine supply chain, or the immunization supply chain. The
cold chain consists of a series of links that are designed to keep vaccines within WHO recommended temperature ranges, from the point of manufacture to the point of
administration. The Figure below illustrates the complete cold chain. The bottom row of arrows shows the flow of vaccines down to the health facilities; the top row of arrows shows
where data are collected, recorded, checked and analysed, and how reporting information flows back up the chain. Following this sequence ensures that cold chain performance is
properly monitored and that the necessary information is gathered for vaccine forecasting.

#### Question 32

Radiological features of rickets

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

X-ray at lower ends of long bones especially wrist due to easy access, rapid growth and soft tissue around is thin

Active rickets

The lower ends show

Broadening; widening of the distal end of the metaphysis (Splaying)

Cupping or concavity; metaphysis changes from a convex or flat surface to a more concave surface

Metaphysis loses its sharp border (Fraying )

Wide joint space

The shaft shows

Rare faction → reduced bone density

Maybe a greenstick fracture.

May be deformities

Healing rickets

Usually seen 2 weeks of vitamin D therapy

The lower ends shows white concave continuous line at ZPC

Less evident features of rickets

Healed rickets

Usually seen 4 - 6 weeks of vitamin D therapy

The lower ends show a straight continuous line at ZPC.

No features of active rickets.

#### Question 33

Fatma, a 4 month old girl (5kg) is brought to the pediatric outpatient clinic by her
mother with complaints of cough, hotness of body and difficulty in breathing for three
days. You observe that she is alert lying in the mother’s arms breastfeeding. On a
rapid assessment you note that she has no noisy breathing. She is breathing at a rate
of 63 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation on room air is at 89%, has no grunting, no
head nodding and no central cyanosis. Lower chest wall indrawing is present but
there is no deep acidotic breathing. Crepitations are heard bilaterally on auscultation.
Rhonchi (wheezes) are absent.

a) What would you do at this point?

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

Ensure my safety ( sanitize hands,wear gloves, put on a mask).

Change the setting because the patient has a decreased level of consciousness
( AVPU less than A at V)

Assess airway and breathing then administer oxygen via nasal prongs at 0.5-1L/ min
because she is hypoxaemic ( SP02 is 89% on room air) which delivers 30-35%
oxygen

Assess circulation and do an RBS, administer 5ml/kg of 10% dextrose over 2-3 min if
glucose is less than 2.5mmol/L.

</details>

b) No other issues are identified in your rapid assessment. What would your working
diagnosis be at this point and why? Give the appropriate classification and justify.

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

Pneumonia: because of acute cough, fever, difficulty in breathing for 3 days and
examination findings of tachypnea, hypoxemia, lower chest wall indrawing and
bilateral crepitations (indicating consolidation) and is alert and able to breastfeed and
has no grunting, head nodding or central cyanosis.

Classification: Severe pneumonia because of presence of hypoxaemia (89 %)

ABC

Airway- secretions- suctioning due to excessive salivation due to increased
cholinergic activity that activates nicotinic and muscarinic receptors and also because
of the bronchorrhea

Breathing- if wheezing nebulize, spo2 low

Circulation- tachycardia and hypertension if nicotinic and bradycardia and
hypotension if muscarinic
Weak pulse and cold extremities- IVF maintenance

Disability- seizures, confusion, tremors, pinpoint pupils (mysosis)
Minimize continuous absorption:
Remove clothes and wash with soap and water

Atropine- symptomatic treatment by preventing cholinergic storm- 0.5mg/kg first hour
Monitor vitals and pupil size- should fully dilate with max Atropine- within 3 hours

Management

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

Supportive:
Analgesics for pain

Neupogen (G-CSF growth factors)- reduces incidence of neutropenia

Antibiotic prophylaxis using penicillin, 3rd generation Cephalosporins for febrile
patients and Antifungals if persistent fever greater than3-5 days

Allopurinol for tumor lysis syndrome

Blood products transfusion for anemia and thrombocytopenia using packed RBCs or Platelet concentrate, fluids and nutrition

Definitive:

Induction (4 weeks)

Vincristine, Doxorubicin, Prednisone, Methotrexate Intra-thecal (MXT IT)

Bone marrow aspirate day 30: for assessment of remission

In the meantime, start consolidation and for those not in remissions consider
giving at least three consolidations

Consolidation

Starts 10-14 days after completing induction

Cyclophosphamide - Day 1 and 8; Vincristine - Day 1 and 8 ; Cytarabine -Days 1-4, 22-25, 29-32

Cranial Radiotherapy (DXT) given to patients starting 7-14 days after completing consolidation

Maintenance

24 months

Starts 4 weeks after completing consolidation and still in remission.

Drugs used; 6-Mercaptopurine daily, Methotrexate weekly , Vincristine monthly, IT Methotrexate every 8 weeks

Adriamycin and Cyclophosphamide every three months


Other treatment modalities
Bone marrow transplantation


Matched-sibling bone marrow transplantation after remission achieves long-
term disease-free survival in about two thirds of patients


Stem cell transplantation
For patients with favorable prognostic features and improved outcome with
chemotherapy, matched sibling stem cell transplantation is recommended
only after a relapse


Matched unrelated donor stem cell transplants may be effective therapy,
Matched unrelated donor transplants are usually reserved for patients who
have a relapse.
