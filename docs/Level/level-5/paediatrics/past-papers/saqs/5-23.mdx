<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
  UTI
</details>

b. Give 8 risk factors for above condition (4 Marks)

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>

  - Previous UTI: history suggestive of, or a confirmed UTI
  - Recurrent fever of unknown origin
  - Immunosuppression: diabetes, HIV
  - Constipation causing urinary obstruction 
  - Spinal lesions 
  - Male (uncircumcised, less than a year)
  - Vesicoureteral reflux
  - Hygiene? 

</details>

c. Explain how you would take a urine sample in this child (3 marks)

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>

  - Suprapubic
  - In and out catheter
  - Midstream urine 

</details>

d. What investigations would you carry out in this child and which test would give you a definitive diagnosis (6 Marks)?

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>

  - Basic bloodwork: FHG, differential WBC. 
  - Markers of inflammation: CRP, ESR.
  - Urine macroscopy, dipstick with nitrite, leukocyte esterase and pyuria.
  - Urine microscopy, culture and sensitivity of suprapubic aspirate, catheter urine, or clean catch urine sample: positive urine culture is the gold standard. Diagnosis of UTI confirmed or excluded based on the number of colony-forming units (cfu). The higher the concentration of organisms the more reliable the results.
    - SPA: any growth
    - Catheter: > 10,000 cfu/ml
    - CCM: > 100,000 cfu/ml
  
  - Indications for culture

    - Age under 3 years with no other focus of infection
    - Suspected acute pyelonephritis/upper UTI
    - Positive dipstick or urinalysis
    - Recurrent UTI (such as in our case)
    - A high to intermediate risk of serious illness
    - Infection not responding to treatment within 24
    - 48 hours (if not already taken)
    - Clinical symptoms and dipstick tests do not correlate

  <p>Imaging:</p>

  - Ultrasound: if normal, no further test 
  - Ultrasound: if abnormal and dilatation seen, MCUG. Other abnormality, refer for DMSA.
  - If ultrasound normal and patient comes back with UTI, repeat ultrasound and DMSA should be done 

</details>

e. What would your treatment plan be under the following areas?

Prevention (2 Marks)

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>

  - Prophylactic antibiotics for recurrent UTI to prevent renal scarring. 
    - TMP-SMX or nitrofurantoin (UpToDate)
  
</details>

Supportive (2 marks)

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>

  - Increased oral fluid intake
  
</details>

Definitive Management (4 marks)

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>

  
  - Prompt initiation of antibiotics after obtaining sample for urinary culture for presumptive management if the following are there (and therefore suggestive of UTI)
    - Positive nitrite screen
    - Positive nitrite and LE screen
    - Positive microscopic examination pyuria and bacteruria
    - NOTE: If urine culture is negative antibiotics should be discontinued
  - Outpatient
    - First line: Cefuroxime or Amoxiclav
    - Alternative: A 3rd gen cephalosporin
  - Inpatient
    - First line: Cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, an aminoglycoside
    - Alternative: Ampicilin + sulbactam, Ceftazidime
  - Infants who do not respond to antimicrobial therapy within two days should undergo ultrasonography promptly and either voiding cystourethrography or radionuclide cystography at the earliest convenient time.
