e. Psychological stress
<p>Bedwetting, also known as nocturnal enuresis, is common in children and can be caused by a variety of factors. In a child who has been previously continent and then starts bedwetting again, psychological stress is the most likely cause. Stressors such as starting a new school, changes in the family dynamic, or a recent traumatic event can trigger bedwetting in children who were previously dry at night.</p>
<p>Diabetes mellitus, spina bifida, a urinary tract infection, and posterior urethral valves can also cause bedwetting in children, but these conditions are less likely given the child's history of previously being continent. A thorough medical evaluation may be needed to rule out these conditions if there are other concerning symptoms or signs on examination.</p>
