### Child Health

a. List & briefly explain the strategies of preventing pneumonia (10 marks)

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
<p>
Primary Prevention — intervening before health effects occur, through measures such as vaccinations, altering risky behaviours (poor eating habits, tobacco use), and banning substances known to be associated with a disease or health condition.
<ul>
  <li>vaccination, including use of vaccines against infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b</li>
  <li>exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life </li>
  <li>improvement of nutrition and prevention of low birth weight</li>
  <li>control of indoor air pollution and provision of a healthy environment e.g. Cleaning of mould</li>
  <li>Improve ventilation in the house – opening windows and doors</li> 
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Secondary Prevention—screening to identify diseases in the earliest stages, before the onset of signs and symptoms, through measures such as mammography and regular blood pressure testing.
<ul>
  <li>Prevention and management of HIV infection.</li>
  <li>Provision of modified diet such as thickened liquids to people at risk of aspiration</li>
  <li>Tx of non-severe pneumonia - antibiotic tx</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Tertiary Prevention—managing disease post diagnosis to slow or stop disease progression through measures such as chemotherapy, rehabilitation, and screening for complications.
<ul>
  <li>case management of pneumonia in the community, health centres and hospitals</li>
  <li>Tx of severe- O2 therapy; Mechanical ventilation</li>
  <li>Rehabilitation- Coz lungs are damaged teach patients to breath small volumes of air</li>
</ul>
</p>

</details>

b. Several children are admitted in your district hospital with fever, maculo-papular rashes and respiratory symptoms. Briefly outline the essential components of the necessary response. (10 marks)

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
  <p>Measles outbreak.</p>
  <p>
    a. Laboratory confirmation of the outbreak. Whenever possible, all
    suspected measles outbreaks should be confirmed by the laboratory
    to be due to measles virus infection. Laboratory confirmation
    involves the presence of measles-specific IgM antibodies
  </p>
  <p>
    b. Ensuring adequate clinical management of cases. Administration
    of vitamin A to children with measles has been shown to decrease
    both the severity of disease and the case-fatality rate, and WHO
    recommends that vitamin A be administered to all children with
    acute measles. One dose (50 000 IU for infants aged less than six
    months, 100 000 IU for infants aged 6–11 months, and 200 000 IU
    for children age more than 12 months) should be administered on
    the day of measles diagnosis, and one dose should be administered
    the following day. Supportive treatment should be provided for all
    cases, including additional fluids (such as oral rehydration
    solution) and antipyretics. Antibiotics should be used for cases
    complicated by otitis media or pneumonia, and nutritional therapy
    is indicated for children with malnutrition. Many children require
    four to eight weeks to fully recover their pre-measles nutritional
    status.
  </p>
  <p>
    c. Intensifying surveillance and notification of suspected cases.
    At the health-facility level, measles surveillance should be
    intensified to actively seek additional cases. In this case, the
    following steps should be taken: 1. Investigate and collect data
    from each suspected case. Data collected should at minimum include
    (name, address, age, sex, date of rash onset, vaccination status,
    date of last vaccination and, if applicable, date of specimen
    collection). 2. Institute weekly reporting, regardless of
    frequency of reporting prior to the outbreak. 3. If possible,
    conduct regular calls or visits to schools, hospital emergency
    rooms and other health facilities, plus selected paediatricians
    for case finding, especially in urban areas. Health authorities
    and health facilities at all levels and in nearby jurisdictions
    should be notified of the outbreak and updated as frequently as
    possible. This will allow them to be on the look-out for increases
    in the number of suspected measles cases and to begin appropriate
    preventive actions in their areas
  </p>
  <p>
    d. Assessing the risk of a large outbreak with high morbidity and
    mortality. Evaluate the susceptibility of the population and
    potential for spread both in the affected and neighbouring areas.
  </p>
  <p>
    e. Investigating a confirmed measles outbreak. 1. Collection of
    data. Data collection should be limited to obtaining basic
    information from each case (name, address, age, sex, immunization
    status, date of last vaccination, symptoms, date of rash onset,
    date of specimen collection, outcome), which should then be added
    to the line-listing. Any additional information on the population
    where the outbreak occurs that may shed light on the presence of
    risk factors for measles infection should, if possible, be
    obtained (e.g. available information on the HIV prevalence or
    nutritional status of the population). The data should be analysed
    rapidly to determine the extent and severity of the outbreak,
    vaccine effectiveness, potential risk factors for measles
    infection, and possible causes of the outbreak (e.g. vaccine
    failure or failure to vaccinate). 2. Describe the outbreak. 3.
    Analyse data using parameters such as attack rate, case fatality
    ratio. 4. Interpret Data
  </p>
  <p>
    f. Implementing control and preventive measures (including
    vaccination activities). 1. Managing cases and contacts to limit
    spread. Limiting contact to only immediate family members who have
    been vaccinated or have prior history of measles. In particular,
    avoid contact with infants or young unimmunized children in the
    household. 2. Conducting appropriate vaccination activities
  </p>
  <p>
    g. Ensuring effective community involvement and public awareness.

  </ul>
</details>

c. Treatment of shock due to dehydration (10 marks)

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
<p>Assess for signs of hypovolemic shock from diarrhea by checking for:
  <ul>
    <li>Weak/absent pulse</li>
    <li>AVPU less than A</li>
    <li>Cold hands + temp gradient</li>
    <li>Capillary refill more than 3s</li>
    <li>Plus sunken eyes and slow skin pinch</li>
  </ul>
If all are presents, give IV or IO Ringer's lactate 20mls/kg over 15 mins. A second bolus may be given if still in shock before proceeding to <strong>step 2 of plan C</strong>. Also treat for hypoglycemia if present with 5mls/kg of 10% dextrose. If patient's Hb is below 5g/dL or severe pallor is present, transfuse urgently with pRBCs 10mls/kg but do not give a bolus. 
</p>
<p>If patient is not in hypovolemic shock but has severe dehydration characterized by:
  <ul>
    <li>Inability to drink or AVPU less than A, and any of the following:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Sunken eyes</li>
        <li>Return of skin pinch more than or equal to 2 secs</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
Start <strong>step 1 of plan C</strong> where 30mls/kg of Ringer's Lactate is administered over 30mins if age is more than or equal to 12 months or over 60 mins if less than 12 months. In <strong>step 1 of plan C</strong> 70 mls/kg of Ringer's Lactate is administered over 2.5 hours if age is more than or equal to 12 months or over 5 hours if less than 12 months.<strong><em>Give ORS at 5mls/kg/h via NGT.</em></strong>
<ul>
    <li>If not able to start IV, give NGT ORS 120 mls/kg over 6hours</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
  Re-assess at least hourly and after 3-6 hours, reclassify as severe,
  some or no dehydration and treat accordingly.
</p>

<p>
  If some dehydration, the patient presents with:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ability to drink adequately but with 2 or more of the following:
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Sunken eyes</li>
      <li>Skin return between 1 - 2 secs</li>
      <li>Restlessness/irritability</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  and <strong>plan B</strong> is started, where ORS is initiated by
  mouth at 75mls/kg over 4 hrs. Breastfeeding is continued as
  tolerated. Reassessment is done after 4 hours, then reclassified and
  treated accordingly. If the child is more than 6 months, encourage
  feeding.
</p>

<p>
  If no dehydration, the patient reports diarrhea but not enough signs
  to classify as some dehydration. In this case,{' '}
  <strong>plan A</strong> is started. 10mls/kg ORS for every loose
  stool or vomiting episode. Breastfeeding is continued. Encourage
  feeding if greater than 6 months.
</p>

<p>Additional therapies:
<ul>
    <li>Oral zinc sulphate for 10-14days at 10mg/day for age less than or equal to 6 months or 20mg/day for age greater than 6 months.</li>
    <li>If dysentery, cholera, malnutrition, amebiasis or giardiasis is suspected, start antibiotic treatment.Amebiasis or giardiasis(Metronidazole 7.5mg/kg 8hrly for 7-10days). Bacterial dysentery(Ciprofloxacin at 15mg/kg 12hrly for at least 3 days)</li>
</ul>
