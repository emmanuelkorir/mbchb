        Keep warm & maintain neutral thermal environment. Reduces
        oxygen consumption
      </li>
      <li>Airway patency should be ensured for adequate flow</li>
      <li>Breathing: Provide CPAP or use Surfactant</li>
      <li>
        Circulation: Early initiation of feeds & maintence fluids
      </li>
      <li>
        Close monitoring of vitals & blood sugar. Hypotension is

        breathing spontaneously, not in respiratory distress. Intended
        to avoid ventilation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rescue CPAP: Above 30 weeks or greater than 1.3kgs. Initiated
        after trial of oxygen therapy. Neonate with increased work of
        breathing and SpO2 less than 90% on nasal prongs at 1L/min
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  Antenatal Corticosteroids promote fetal lung maturity and should be
  administered 1-7 days before birth or at 24-24 weeks gestation. Use
