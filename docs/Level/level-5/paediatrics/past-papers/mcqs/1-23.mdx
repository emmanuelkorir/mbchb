<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
  Meningitis.
  <p>
    {' '}
    Water-dispersed infections are the fifth category of diseases associated
    with water that is emerging in developed countries; infections whose
    pathogens can proliferate in freshwater and enter the body through
    the respiratory tract. Some freshwater amoebae that are not usually
    pathogenic can proliferate in warm water, and if they enter the host
    in large numbers, they can invade the body along the olfactory tracts
    and cause fatal meningitis. These bacteria can be dispersed as aerosols
    from air-conditioning systems; an example of this type of disease is
    Legionella. Others are:
  </p>
  <p>
    Water-related diseases are a category for which water may provide
    a habitat for insect vectors of water-related diseases. Mosquitoes
    breed in water and the adult mosquitoes may transmit parasite
    diseases, such as malaria, and virus infections, such as dengue,
    yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Water-based diseases are a category for which water provides the
    habitat for intermediate host organisms in which some parasites
    pass part of their life cycle. These are later the cause of
    disease in people as their infective larval forms in fresh water
    find their way back to humans, either by boring through wet skin
    or by being ingested with water plants, minute water crustacea, or
    raw or inadequately cooked fish. Schistosomiasis is an example of
    a water-based disease.
  </p>
  <p>
    Water-privation diseases are a category that is affected more by
    the quantity of water rather than by quality. These diseases
    spread through direct contact with infected people or materials
    contaminated with the infectious agent. Infrequent washing and
    inadequate personal hygiene are the main factors in these types of
    diseases, such as certain types of diarrheal diseases, helminthes,
    and skin and eye infections.
  </p>
  <p>
    Waterborne diseases arise from the contamination of water by human
    or animal feces or urine infected by pathogenic viruses or
    bacteria, which are directly transmitted when the water is drunk
    or used in the preparation of food. Examples are cholera, typhoid,
    and cryptosporidiosis.
