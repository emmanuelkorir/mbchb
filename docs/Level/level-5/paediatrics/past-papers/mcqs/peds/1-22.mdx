### Question 1

You are reviewing the data of County X with a population of 500, 000. The total births in 2020 were 2, 500 of which 150 were still births. 200 infants died in the same year, of which 150 died in the first four weeks of life.

a) Calculate the infant mortality rate and show your working. (4 marks)

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
  <p>
    Infant Mortality Rate = (Number of Infant Deaths / Number of Live
    Births) x 1,000
  </p>
  <p>
    Number of Live Births = Total Births - Stillbirths = 2,500 - 150 =
    2,350
  </p>
  <p>Infant Mortality Rate = (200 / 2,350) x 1,000 = 85.1</p>
  <p>
    Therefore, the infant mortality rate for County X in 2020 was 85.1
    deaths per 1,000 live births.
  </p>
</details>

b) Calculate the neonatal mortality rate (3 marks)

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
  <p>
    Neonatal Mortality Rate = (Number of neonatal deaths / Number of
    live births) x 1000
  </p>
  <p>Number of neonatal deaths = 150</p>
  <p>
    Number of Live Births = Total Births - Stillbirths = 2,500 - 150 =
    2,350
  </p>
  <p>NMR = (150 / 2,350) x 1,000</p>
  <p>NMR = 63.83 deaths per 1,000 live births</p>
</details>

c) With justification, how does this compare with Kenya's infant and neonatal mortality rates from the latest KDHS report? (3 marks 1 mark each)

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
  Kenya figures: Infant MR = 32/1000, Neonate MR = 21/1000, Under 5 mortality
  rate = 41/1000. Compared with Kenya's figures, County X has a higher
  infant and neonatal mortality rate.

d) Outline three leading causes of death amongst neonates that could explain the high
NMR in a county in Kenya X (3 marks)

</details>

c) Briefly describe the pathophysiology of acute bacterial meningitis (10marks)

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
  <p>Pathogenesis & Pathophysiology</p>
  <p>
    Bacteria reach the subarachnoid space via a hematogenous route and
    may directly reach the meninges in patients with a parameningeal
    focus of infection. Once pathogens enter the subarachnoid space,
    an intense host inflammatory response is triggered by lipoteichoic
    acid and other bacterial cell wall products. This response is
    mediated by the stimulation of macrophage-equivalent brain cells
    that produce cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. This
    resultant cytokine activation then initiates several processes
    that ultimately cause damage in the subarachnoid space,
    culminating in neuronal injury and apoptosis. ILâ€”I, TNF-a, and
    enhanced nitric oxide production play critical roles in triggering
    inflammatory response and neurologic damage.
  </p>
  <p>
    Infection and inflammatory response later affect penetrating
    cortical vessels leading to swelling and proliferation of the
    endothelial cells of arterioles. A similar process can involve the
    veins, causing mural thrombi and obstruction of flow. Increased in
    intracellular sodium and water. Brain oedema further compromises
    cerebral circulation intracranial pressure and uncal herniation.
    Increased secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), resulting in
    SIADH, occurs in most patients with meningitis further retention
    of free water.{' '}
  </p>
  <p>
    These factors contribute to the development of focal or
    generalized seizures.
  </p>
  <p>
    Severe brain edema also causes midline structures to shift
    caudally and become entrapped in the tentorial notch or foramen
    magnum.
  </p>
  <p>
    Caudal shifts produce herniation of the parahippocampal gyri,
    cerebellum, or both.
  </p>
  <p>
    These intracranial changes appear clinically as an alteration of
    consciousness and postural reflexes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Caudal displacement of the brainstem causes palsy of the third and
    sixth cranial nerves.
  </p>
  <p>
    If untreated, these changes result in decortication or
    decerebration and can progress rapidly to respiratory and cardiac
    arrest.
  </p>
