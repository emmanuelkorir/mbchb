b. List the key principles in the physiology of breastfeeding (10marks)

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
This involves breast milk production and let down reflex enables breastmilk secretion. Prolactin is a hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland that rises during pregnancy, and is responsible for production of milk. It is supported by production of human chorionic somatomammotropin by the placenta which has lactogenic properties. Production begins mid pregnancy and only a few millimetres of  milk are secreted into the breasts everyday until the baby is born due to the suppressive effects of estrogen and progesterone. After the delivery of the placenta, there will be abrupt decrease in progesterone levels, prolactin produced which stimulates milk production. Milk flows continuously into the alveoli, but is only ejected when there is a neurogenic and hormonal reflex e.g. during suckling. When the baby suckles, a sensory impulse is sent to the mother's spinal cord and hypothalamus which leads to the secretion of oxytocin and prolactin. The oxytocin causes the myoepithelial cells around the alveoli to contract, thus ejecting the milk into the ducts and into the nipple(let down reflex). Factors that hinder the reflex include:stress, medications like beta blockers and alcohol and caffeine. Factors that enable the reflex include getting sufficient rest to reduce fatigue, gently massaging the breast before breastfeeding,seeking  support from a lactation consultant for any structural abnormalities.

  </li>
  <p>  History of fever, diarrhea and vomiting for 2 days with lethargy, inability
  to drink and cold peripheries with a weak pulse is suggestive of gastroenteritis/acute
  diarrhea.</p>
</details>

c. Describe the steps of management of this infant (20 marks)

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
<p>Assess for signs of hypovolemic shock from diarrhea by checking for:
  <ul>
    <li>Weak/absent pulse</li>
    <li>AVPU less than A</li>
    <li>Cold hands + temp gradient</li>
    <li>Capillary refill more than 3s</li>
    <li>Plus sunken eyes and slow skin pinch</li>
  </ul>
If all are presents, give IV or IO Ringer's lactate 20mls/kg over 15 mins. A second bolus may be given if still in shock before proceeding to <strong>step 2 of plan C</strong>. Also treat for hypoglycemia if present with 5mls/kg of 10% dextrose. If patient's Hb is below 5g/dL or severe pallor is present, transfuse urgently with pRBCs 10mls/kg but do not give a bolus. 
</p>
<p>If patient is not in hypovolemic shock but has severe dehydration characterized by:
  <ul>
    <li>Inability to drink or AVPU less than A, and any of the following:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Sunken eyes</li>
        <li>Return of skin pinch more than or equal to 2 secs</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
Start <strong>step 1 of plan C</strong> where 30mls/kg of Ringer's Lactate is administered over 30mins if age is more than or equal to 12 months or over 60 mins if less than 12 months. In <strong>step 1 of plan C</strong> 70 mls/kg of Ringer's Lactate is administered over 2.5 hours if age is more than or equal to 12 months or over 5 hours if less than 12 months.<strong><em>Give ORS at 5mls/kg/h via NGT.</em></strong>
<ul>
    <li>If not able to start IV, give NGT ORS 120 mls/kg over 6hours</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
  Re-assess at least hourly and after 3-6 hours, reclassify as severe,
  some or no dehydration and treat accordingly.
</p>

<p>
  If some dehydration, the patient presents with:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ability to drink adequately but with 2 or more of the following:
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Sunken eyes</li>
      <li>Skin return between 1 - 2 secs</li>
      <li>Restlessness/irritability</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  and <strong>plan B</strong> is started, where ORS is initiated by
  mouth at 75mls/kg over 4 hrs. Breastfeeding is continued as
  tolerated. Reassessment is done after 4 hours, then reclassified and
  treated accordingly. If the child is more than 6 months, encourage
  feeding.
</p>

<p>
  If no dehydration, the patient reports diarrhea but not enough signs
  to classify as some dehydration. In this case,{' '}
  <strong>plan A</strong> is started. 10mls/kg ORS for every loose
  stool or vomiting episode. Breastfeeding is continued. Encourage
  feeding if greater than 6 months.
</p>

<p>Additional therapies:
<ul>
    <li>Oral zinc sulphate for 10-14days at 10mg/day for age less than or equal to 6 months or 20mg/day for age greater than 6 months.</li>
    <li>If dysentery, cholera, malnutrition, amebiasis or giardiasis is suspected, start antibiotic treatment.Amebiasis or giardiasis(Metronidazole 7.5mg/kg 8hrly for 7-10days). Bacterial dysentery(Ciprofloxacin at 15mg/kg 12hrly for at least 3 days)</li>

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>

  More than 1 joint
  
  More than 6 weeks
  
  Less than 16 years
  
  Signs & Symptoms:

  Arthritic symptoms - Swollen joints, rarely erythema; Early morning stiffness that improves with activity; Limited or painful joint movement
  
  Extra-articular manifestations - Fever (for more than 2 weeks); painless anterior uveitis(upto 20% of JIA pts); Rash; fatigue; malaise; wt loss
  
  Nonspecific features - Excessive crying; Lethargy; Decreased scholastic performance
  
  Labs tests: 

  Autoantibodies levels: Rheumatoid factor (Classification of polyarticular disease. Absent in most cases of JIA except seropositive polyarticular JIA); Increased anti-nuclear antibodies(ANA - common in oligoarticular JIA; uveitis risk assessment), anti-CCP (indicate poor prognosis)
  
  Acute phase reactants: Increased ESR and CRP

  CBC: Anemia of chronic diseases; Leucocytosis; Thrombocytosis

  Imaging: Ultrasound - Used to detect synovial hypertrophy and intraarticular fluid collections. Best imagistic tool for the detection of early bone erosions

  X-ray - May be used for the identification of JIA complications. Still the gold standard

  MRI - Most sensitive imaging modality. Can show sub-clinical joint inflammation

  Synovial biopsy - Can provide a definitive diagnosis of JIA. Shows infiltration of plasma cells, B lymphocytes, and T lymphocytes
  
  Slit lamp examination: should be performed for regular ophthalmological screening in patients with anterior uveitis
  
  Supportive management: Physiotherapy to prevent joint deformities; Occupational therapy; Psychosocial support - Counselling and advice regarding schooling, sporting activities, misleading information and prognosis; Pain management
  
  Definitive: 
  
  NSAIDS - First-line. Indomethacin - Commonly used; highly effective in the treatment of JIA. Others - naproxen, ibuprofen, meloxicam, celecoxib, and tolmetin
  
  Intra-articular steroids - Used in the treatment of acute flares of JIA. 

  DMARDs - Methotrexate

  Biologic DMARDS - Etanercept and adalimumab anti-TNF. Tocilizumab - IL-6 inhibitor. Anakinra - IL-1 inhibitor.
