<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
<p>Keeping warm</p>
<p>Hydration. Take plenty of fluids especially during hot season. A sickler requires 1.5 times as much fluid as a non-sickler.</p>
<p>Penicillin prophylaxis: Patients with SCD are prone to infection and death from encapsulated bacterial organisms
like Streptococcal pneumoniae due to splenic dysfunction that occurs within the first 5 years
of life. It is therefore recommended that children with SCD should have penicillin prophylaxis
started within 2 months of life and continued until 5 years of age. However, for patients who
have had surgical splenectomy, it is given for life. Its use may be continued until later in life
for children who have had more than two episodes of severe pneumonia. The dose of:
<ul>
    <li>Children less than 3 years: Penicillin V syrup 125mg twice daily</li>
    <li>Children more than 3 years: Penicillin V syrup/tablets 250mg twice daily</li>
    <li>Patients with penicillin hypersensitivity may use erythromycin as an alternative</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Immunization practices:
    <ul>
        <li>Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (Pneumo-23): At 2 years and once every 5years</li>
        <li>Influenza vaccine: Annually</li>
        <li>Meningococcal vaccine: 2 doses for those below 2 years of age and one
dose for those above 2years</li>
        <li>Hemophilus influenza type B: Booster at 18months</li>
        <li>Neisseria meningitidis</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Hydroxyurea use: It reduces painful crisis, blood transfusion and
infection in patients with SCD. </p>
<p>Chronic Transfusion Therapy: The aim of chronic transfusion therapy is to keep the HbS level <30%. Indicated in primary stroke prevention, recurrent acute chest syndrome, pulmonary htn, leg ulcers.</p>
<p>Pain management using analgesics like PCM, NSAIDS, or morphine. Mild pain management using hot packs, reassurance, reposition & massage.</p>
<p>Psychosocial Support: Patients go
through periods of pain, requirements for inpatient care with separation from their families or
daily activities, physiological changes in their bodies due to the chronic hemolysis and the
potential threat of SCD complications. Parents experience guilt of having passed the sickle
cell gene to their child, challenges of watching their children experience the complications of
SCD like pain, absenteeism from work as they regularly seek health care for their children and
the financial drain of the disease. Adults with SCD sometimes also experience stigma when
choosing marital partners and when making career choices. This necessitates that patients
and their families are offered psychosocial support within the healthcare system or as part of
patient support groups.</p>
<p>Nutritional Support: SCD patients should eat diets with healthy nutritious foods just like other normal children.
Parents should be encouraged to give their children plenty of water or fluids. Folic acid
supplementation is necessary due to its increased demand from the chronic hemolysis</p>
<p>Malaria Prophylaxis: SCD patients are susceptible to malaria infection which may have serious consequences. It is
recommended that for patients living in high transmission malaria areas or non-immune
individuals that prophylactic antimalarial drugs are used in addition to the general
precautions (e.g. use of insecticide treated mosquito nets and environmental measures).
Patients living in low malarial transmission zones do not require prophylaxis. Drugs that can be used for prophylaxis are proguanil or mefloquine.</p>
<p>Routine Clinic Follow Ups: Patients with SCD require to be reviewed regularly at least once every 8-12 weeks. The
following algorithms can be used for the first and subsequent clinic visits.</p>

### Question 61

A boy is affected with a genetically transmitted disease. He has one brother who is not affected. He has 2 sisters, one is affected and the other one not. His father is normal but the mother has the disease. His mother's sisters (his aunts) are all affected but the mother's brothers are not. His father's siblings
are not affected. His maternal grandfather was affected but the maternal grandmother was normal. The disease is most likely transmitted:

Select one:

a. X-linked dominant

b. Multifactorial

c. Autosomal recessive

d. Autosomal dominant

e. X-linked recessive

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
a. X-linked dominant

<p>The boy has the disease, which means he inherited the disease-causing allele from his mother.
The mother has the disease, which means she inherited the disease-causing allele from one of her parents.
The mother's sisters are affected, which means they also inherited the disease-causing allele from their mother.
The maternal grandfather was affected, which means he must have had at least one copy of the disease-causing allele.
The maternal grandmother was normal, which means she did not have the disease-causing allele.
The father's siblings are not affected, which suggests that the disease is not autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive.
The fact that both males and females can be affected (the boy and one of his sisters are affected) suggests that the disease is not X-linked recessive.
Therefore, the most likely explanation is that the disease is X-linked dominant, which means that a female carrier has a 50% chance of passing the disease-causing allele to each of her offspring, regardless of their sex.</p>
