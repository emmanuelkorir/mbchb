### Question 1

A four year old girl is brought to the hospital emergency department because of crying,
fever and holding ofthe left ear for the preceding four hours. A quick examination reveals
a very red and bulging left tympanic membrane. There is fever Of 390 (axilla). Further
inquiry reveals that she has had a congested nose for four days, and a painful cough for
two days. She has otherwise been a healthy child before this illness. (25marks)

i. What is the most likely diagnosis? (3marks)

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
  Acute otitis media which is secondary to an upper respiratory tract infection.
</details>

ii. What are the most likely causative organisms? (3marks)

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Streptococcus pneumoniae</li>
    <li>Staphylococcus aureus</li>
    <li>Haemophilus influenzae</li>
    <li>Moraxella catarrhalis</li>
  </ul>
</details>

iii. Briefly outline the steps of progression Of this problem. (7marks)

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
  Acute otitis media mostly flows when there is blockage of the eustachian
  tubes due to precipitating upper respiratory tract infections. This blockage
  can also be caused by hypertrophied adenoids. Upper airway blockage can
  also cause the accumulation of secretions which act asa niche for bacterial
  overgrowth. Ultimately, this will lead to middle ear colonization and
  suppurative effusion.
</details>

    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
  <p>Primary diagnosis is sickle cell anemia.</p>

ii. Outline the Steps in the process that leads to or that underlies yellowing Of his eyes (4 marks)

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
  In the presence low oxygen tension and other stressors like infections,
  dehydration and acidosis, hemoglobin S undergoes polymerization to form
  an abnormally shaped sickle cells. Sickled RBCswill be destroyed by the
  spleen to produce heme and globin. The heme will be converted by heme
  oxygenase to biliverdin which will in turn will be converted to bilirubin
  by biliverdin reductase. Biliverdin is the element that causes yellow
  discoloration of the eyes and skin.
