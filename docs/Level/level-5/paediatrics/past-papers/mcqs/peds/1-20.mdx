### Question 1


A 4-year old boy who is known to have Sickle Cell Anemia since 9 months of age has recently traveled back from Western Kenya and presented to the emergency department. 2 days history of Pain, Fever. and Convulsions. Mother reports loss of speech at presentation.


On Physical examination: He is sick looking with decreased consciousness CNS exam AVPU is at P
Decreased power on the Right upper and lower limbs power at grade 3.


a. What is the diagnosis and differential diagnosis? (4 marks)

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
<p> Diagnosis- Vaso occlusive crisis causing stroke in a patient with Sickle cell disease </p>

<p> Differentials: Cerebral malaria; Acute bacterial Meningitis; Space occupying lesion eg brain abscess, encephalitis; AV malformation; Cerebral vascular accident </p>
</details>


b. Describe briefly the pathophysiology of crisis that occur in sickle cell anemia (8 marks)

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
  <p>
    Most of the sickle cell crises are precipitated by metabolic
    derangements, infection and stress. These lead to abnormal
    polymerization of the hemoglobin chain in the abnormal HbS. Some
    of the precipitants include: infections, dehydration, acidosis,
    hypoxemia.
  </p>
  <p>
    Vaso occlusive and painful crisis- comes due to occlusion of blood
    vessels by abnormally shaped sickled red cells that cause ischemia
    and tissue necrosis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Aplastic crisis- this is mainly caused by infection with
    Parvovirus B-19 which has affinity for erythroid precursorss in
    the bone marrow and destroys them, causing an acute decrease in
    the red cell production.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hemolytic crisis with associated jaundice: due to splenic
    phagocytes, abnormal red cells are destroyed in the spleen in
    large numbers causing indirect hyperbilirubinemia leading to
    jaundice. This crisis is also characterized by reticulocytosis due
    to compensatory erythropoiesis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sequestration crisis: this is characterised by sudden tender
    splenomegally due to venous occlusion in the splenic outflow
    circulation, that leads to excessive pooling of blood in the
    spleen, and this can in turn lead to autosplenectomy in the long
    run. Sequestration can also lead to priapism which is the pooling
    of blood in the shaft of the penis.
  </p>

c. Outline the steps of emergency management (5 marks)

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
<ul>
    <li>
      Establish safety of the patient by removing sharps and you
      should wear PPEs
    </li>
    <li>
      Check for airway adequacy by looking into the mouth: suction
      what you see only.
    </li>
    <li>
      Check for adequacy of breathing: check presence of respiratory
      distress, grunting, severe chestwall indrwaing,head nodding,
      central and peripheral cyanosis, Sp02 levels. Give oxygen by
      nasal catheter or prongs at 1-2 Limin aiming for Sp02 of 90-96%
      .
    </li>
    <li>
      Assessment of Circulation: check for the presence of Large pulse
      and rate, temperature gradient, capillary refill, any pallor,
      dehydration. If there is severe pallor and acidotic breathing,
      transfuse 20ml per kg Of whole blood or 10 ml per kg Of packed
      red cells. If otherwise, give 20mls/kg of RL over 2 hours.
    </li>
    <li>
      Disability- check for AVPU, do RES, if less than 2.5 mmol/L give
      10mls/kg of 10% dextrose over 2-3 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fix a line and take blood samples for FBC to check for
      anemia,PBF for malaria slides, Electrolytes and blood culture.
    </li>
    <li>
      Give the patient antipyretics and analgesics -ideally
      paracetamol
    </li>
    <li>
      Do imaging studies eg MRI to detect space occupying lesions
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>


d. Outline the principles of long-term management of Sickle Cell Anemia (8 marks)

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
  <p>Keeping warm</p>
  <p>
    Hydration. Take plenty of fluids especially during hot season. A
    sickler requires 1.5 times as much fluid as a non-sickler.
  </p>
  <p>
    Penicillin prophylaxis: Patients with SCD are prone to infection
    and death from encapsulated bacterial organisms like Streptococcal
    pneumoniae due to splenic dysfunction that occurs within the first
    5 years of life. It is therefore recommended that children with
    SCD should have penicillin prophylaxis started within 2 months of
    life and continued until 5 years of age. However, for patients who
    have had surgical splenectomy, it is given for life. Its use may
    be continued until later in life for children who have had more
    than two episodes of severe pneumonia. The dose of:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Children less than 3 years: Penicillin V syrup 125mg twice
        daily
      </li>
      <li>
        Children more than 3 years: Penicillin V syrup/tablets 250mg
        twice daily
      </li>
      <li>
        Patients with penicillin hypersensitivity may use erythromycin
        as an alternative
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Immunization practices:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (Pneumo-23): At 2 years
        and once every 5years
      </li>
      <li>Influenza vaccine: Annually</li>
      <li>
        Meningococcal vaccine: 2 doses for those below 2 years of age
        and one dose for those above 2years
      </li>
      <li>Hemophilus influenza type B: Booster at 18months</li>
      <li>Neisseria meningitidis</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Hydroxyurea use: It reduces painful crisis, blood transfusion and
    infection in patients with SCD.{' '}
  </p>
  <p>
    Chronic Transfusion Therapy: The aim of chronic transfusion
    therapy is to keep the HbS level less than 30%. Indicated in
    primary stroke prevention, recurrent acute chest syndrome,
    pulmonary htn, leg ulcers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pain management using analgesics like PCM, NSAIDS, or morphine.
    Mild pain management using hot packs, reassurance, reposition &
    massage.
  </p>
  <p>
    Psychosocial Support: Patients go through periods of pain,
    requirements for inpatient care with separation from their
    families or daily activities, physiological changes in their
    bodies due to the chronic hemolysis and the potential threat of
    SCD complications. Parents experience guilt of having passed the
    sickle cell gene to their child, challenges of watching their
    children experience the complications of SCD like pain,
    absenteeism from work as they regularly seek health care for their
    children and the financial drain of the disease. Adults with SCD
    sometimes also experience stigma when choosing marital partners
    and when making career choices. This necessitates that patients
    and their families are offered psychosocial support within the
    healthcare system or as part of patient support groups.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nutritional Support: SCD patients should eat diets with healthy
    nutritious foods just like other normal children. Parents should
    be encouraged to give their children plenty of water or fluids.
    Folic acid supplementation is necessary due to its increased
    demand from the chronic hemolysis
  </p>
  <p>
    Malaria Prophylaxis: SCD patients are susceptible to malaria
    infection which may have serious consequences. It is recommended
    that for patients living in high transmission malaria areas or
    non-immune individuals that prophylactic antimalarial drugs are
    used in addition to the general precautions (e.g. use of
    insecticide treated mosquito nets and environmental measures).
    Patients living in low malarial transmission zones do not require
    prophylaxis. Drugs that can be used for prophylaxis are proguanil
    or mefloquine.
  </p>
  <p>
    Routine Clinic Follow Ups: Patients with SCD require to be
    reviewed regularly at least once every 8-12 weeks. The following
    algorithms can be used for the first and subsequent clinic visits.
  </p>
