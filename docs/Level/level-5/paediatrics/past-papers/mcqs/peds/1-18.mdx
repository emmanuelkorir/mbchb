### Question 4

a. What does the term "cold chain system" mean in vaccine management? (3 marks)

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
  Cold chain is a system of storing and transporting vaccines at recommended
  temperatures by manufacturers from point of manufacture to the point
  of use.To maintain potency (the ability of the vaccine to protect against
  disease), vaccines must be protected against extreme temperatures.
</details>

b. What is a vaccine vial monitor (VVM) and how does one interpret the different stages on the monitor?

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
  These are heat sensitive labels placed on vaccine vials to register cumulative
  heat exposure (a label containing a heat-sensitive material which is
  placed on a vaccine vial to register cumulative heat over time). They
  are not an indicator of vaccine potency but indicate temperature that
  may end up affecting potency.
  <p>
    {' '}
    The dual effects of time and temperature cause the VVM's inner core
    to darken, irreversibly, in a gradual manner. The degree of color change
    indicates how much exposure to improper temperatures has occurred.{' '}
  </p>
  <p>
    {' '}
    The VVM is designed to be read at the time of vaccine administration.
    The VVM is not a substitute for proper vaccine storage and handling.{' '}
  </p>
  <p>
    {' '}
    If the inner square is lighter than outer ring and if the expiry date
    has not been passed, the vaccine may be used.{' '}
  </p>
  <p>
    {' '}
    If the inner square is matches the colour of the outer ring or is darker
    than the outer ring and the expiry date has passed, the vaccine must
    be discarded.{' '}
  </p>
  <p>
    {' '}
    VVM is not affected by freezing temperature since it only reacts to
    increases in heat

d. Describe the procedure for conducting the shake test. (4 marks)

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>

<p>
  The "shake test" is designed to detect freeze damage in
  aluminum-based, adsorbed. freeze sensitive voccines such as DTP, DT,
  Td, TT, typhoid, and hepatitis B If you suspect that a vaccine has
  been frozen (e.g. thermometer marks temperature)
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Step 1. Freeze a vial until it is solid; this will be your frozen
    vial - call it "CONTROL".
  </li>
  <li>Step 2. Allow CONTROL vial to thaw completely.</li>
  <li>
    Step 3. Select one sample of each vaccine you suspect has been
    frozen - call it "TEST".
  </li>
  <li>
    Step 4. Shake CONTROL and TEST vials. Hold the Control and Test
    Sample together in one hand and vigorously shake the samples
  </li>
  <li>
    {' '}
    Step 5. Observe CONTROL and TEST vials side-by side to compare how
    they sediment (30 minutes). Place both vials to rest on a flat surfoce,
    side-by-side observe them for 30 minutes & compare the rate of sedimentation
  </li>

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

E. WHO. recommends that only microbiologically confirmed dysentery episodes should be treated with antibiotics

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
C. Dysentery occurs with increased frequency and severity in children who have measles or have had measles in the preceding month

<p>Persistent diarrhoea can have other underlying causes like inflammatory bowel conditions.</p>
<p>In amoebiasis, stool microscopy is not sensitive, especially in later phases, so at least three stool samples should be examined before reporting a negative result.</p>

B. Only about 10% of infants infected perinatally will develop chronic infection

C. No therapy prevents the development of chronic subclinical hepatitis once infection is acquired

D. All children with chronic HBY infection should not be immunized with hepatitis A vaccine

E. Like HIV,HBV can survive outside the body for at least 7 days. During that time, the virus cannot cause infection if it enters the body of a person who is not infected

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
A. Postpartum transmission occurs commonly through exposure to infectious maternal blood, saliza, stool, urine or breast milk

<p>Hep A vaccine contraindications include severe reactions to vaccine components. HBV can survive outside the body for 7 days during which time it is infective.</p>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), up to 90% of infants who are infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) at birth or during early childhood will develop chronic infection.</p>
<p>Early administration of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and the hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth can prevent perinatal transmission in most cases.</p>
<p>The CDC recommends that all children with chronic HBV infection should be immunized against hepatitis A to prevent co-infection with hepatitis A virus.</p>

B. Initially there is only regurgitation of occasional non projectile vomiting. Frequent regurgitation progressing to projectile, nonbilious vomiting immediately after feeding

<p>Symptoms usually develop between the 2nd and 7th week of age (rarely after the 12th week).</p>
<p>The treatment for pyloric stenosis usually involves surgery to correct the obstruction. After surgery, oral feeds are usually started within 24-48 hours. </p>

<summary>Check Answer</summary>
E. MRI and cranial ultrasound identifies the specific cause and severity of the hydrocephalus

<p>Meningoencephalitis presents like meningitis: fever, stiff neck, bulging fontanelles etc. Acetazolamide is effective only in cases of increased CSF production (communicating hydrocephalus). In this cause it could be a non-communicating e.g aqueductal stenosis, Dandy walker syndrome or even SOL. Hydranencephaly is worse than hydrocephalus as it combines anencephaly with hydrocephalus</p>

E. All conjugated vaccines are live attenuated vaccines

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
D. Hib vaccine is an example of a conjugated vaccine

<p>MMR is a live attenuated</p>
<p>Conjugated vaccines are not defined by having more than one vaccine antigen. They are defined by the process of conjugation, in which a bacterial polysaccharide is chemically linked to a carrier protein to improve the immune response. MMR is a combination vaccine that contains three live attenuated viruses: measles, mumps, and rubella.</p>
<p>Conjugated vaccines tend to induce a better immune response than polysaccharide vaccines because they elicit a T-cell-dependent response, whereas polysaccharide vaccines elicit a T-cell-independent response.</p>
<p>Meningitis C vaccine is available in a conjugated form, and it is known as MenC conjugate vaccine.</p>
