### Question 1

A 4-year old boy who is known to have Sickle Cell Anemia since 9 months of age has
recently travelled back from Western Kenya and presents to the emergency department. 2
days history of Pain, Fever, and Convulsions. Mother reports loss Of speech at
presentation.

On Physical examination: He is sick looking with decreased consciousness CNS exam AVPU
is at P. Decreased power on the Right upper and lower limbs power at grade 3.

a. What is the diagnosis and differential diagnosis? (4 marks)

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
  <p>
    {' '}
    Diagnosis- Vaso occlusive crisis causing stroke in a patient with Sickle
    cell disease{' '}
  </p>
  <p>
    Differentials: Cerebral malaria; Acute bacterial Meningitis; Space
    occupying lesion eg brain abscess, encephalitis; AV malformation;
    Cerebral vascular accident
  </p>
</details>

b. Describe briefly the pathophysiology Of crisis that occur in sickle cell anemia (8marks)

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
  <p>
    Most of the sickle cell crises are precipitated by metabolic
    derangements, infection and stress. These lead to abnormal
    polymerization of the hemoglobin chain in the abnormal HbS. Some
    of the precipitants include: infections, dehydration, acidosis,
    hypoxemia.
  </p>
  <p>
    Vaso occlusive and painful crisis- comes due to occlusion of blood
    vessels by abnormally shaped sickled red cells that cause ischemia
    and tissue necrosis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Aplastic crisis- this is mainly caused by infection with
    Parvovirus B-19 which has affinity for erythroid precursorss in
    the bone marrow and destroys them, causing an acute decrease in
    the red cell production.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hemolytic crisis with associated jaundice: due to splenic
    phagocytes, abnormal red cells are destroyed in the spleen in
    large numbers causing indirect hyperbilirubinemia leading to
    jaundice. This crisis is also characterized by reticulocytosis due
    to compensatory erythropoiesis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sequestration crisis: this is characterised by sudden tender
    splenomegally due to venous occlusion in the splenic outflow
    circulation, that leads to excessive pooling of blood in the
    spleen, and this can in turn lead to autosplenectomy in the long
    run. Sequestration can also lead to priapism which is the pooling
    of blood in the shaft of the penis.

  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>

    <li>
      The Widal test is a nonspecific test that measures antibodies
      against the bacteria Salmonella typhi, the cause of typhoid
      fever, in the blood. It is not considered a reliable diagnostic
      tool, especially in young children.
    </li>
    <li>
      Leukocytosis (an increase in white blood cell count) is a common
      finding in typhoid fever, but the level can vary depending on

    cracked pot sound. Positive test is indication of separated
    sutures. This is due to raised intracranial tension.

### Question 26

Which of the following is TRUE concerning the composition of human breastmilk?

Select one:

a. It contains adequate amount of iron for a preterm baby in the first 6 months of life

b. It has a higher whey to casein ratio

c. It has higher content of calcium compared to cow's milk

d. It provides 50% of the caloric needs during the second year of life

e. It contains adequate amount of vitamin D for a term baby in the first 6 months of life

<details>
  <summary>Check Answer</summary>
  b. It has a higher whey to casein ratio.
  <p>
    Human milk contains these in a ratio of 40:60 respectively; while
    in cow’s milk the ratio of casein to whey proteins is 80:20. Given
    that the amount of total protein in cow’s milk is more than double
    that of human milk, cow’s milk clearly contains considerably more
    casein than human milk. Casein can be difficult to digest, in fact
    it is used as the basis of some glues! Infant milks are formulated
    to contain more whey than casein (the ratio of whey to casein in
    these milks is similar to that of human milk), and this is why it
    is thought to be easier for new babies to digest. Casein has been
    linked to a range of diseases and allergies, including type 1
    diabetes
