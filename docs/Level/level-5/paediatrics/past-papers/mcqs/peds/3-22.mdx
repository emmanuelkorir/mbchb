    <li>Capillary refill more than 3s</li>
    <li>Plus sunken eyes and slow skin pinch</li>
  </ul>
If all are presents, give IV or IO Ringer's lactate 20mls/kg over 15 mins. A second bolus may be given if still in shock before proceeding to <strong>step 2 of plan C</strong>. Also treat for hypoglycemia if present with 5mls/kg of 10% dextrose. If patient's Hb is below 5g/dL or severe pallor is present, transfuse urgently with pRBCs 10mls/kg but do not give a bolus. 
</p>
<p>If patient is not in hypovolemic shock but has severe dehydration characterized by:

  </ul>
Start <strong>step 1 of plan C</strong> where 30mls/kg of Ringer's Lactate is administered over 30mins if age is more than or equal to 12 months or over 60 mins if less than 12 months. In <strong>step 2 of plan C</strong> 70 mls/kg of Ringer's Lactate is administered over 2.5 hours if age is more than or equal to 12 months or over 5 hours if less than 12 months.<strong><em>Give ORS at 5mls/kg/h via NGT.</em></strong>
<ul>
    <li>If not able to start IV, give NGT ORS 120 mls/kg over 6hours</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
  Re-assess at least hourly and after 3-6 hours, reclassify as severe,
  some or no dehydration and treat accordingly.
</p>

<p>
  If some dehydration, the patient presents with:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ability to drink adequately but with 2 or more of the following:

    </ul>
  </ul>
  and <strong>plan B</strong> is started, where ORS is initiated by
  mouth at 75mls/kg over 4 hrs. Breastfeeding is continued as
  tolerated. Reassessment is done after 4 hours, then reclassified and
  treated accordingly. If the child is more than 6 months, encourage
  feeding.
</p>

<p>
  If no dehydration, the patient reports diarrhea but not enough signs
  to classify as some dehydration. In this case,{' '}
  <strong>plan A</strong> is started. 10mls/kg ORS for every loose
  stool or vomiting episode. Breastfeeding is continued. Encourage
  feeding if greater than 6 months.
</p>

<p>Additional therapies:
<ul>
    <li>Oral zinc sulphate for 10-14days at 10mg/day for age less than or equal to 6 months or 20mg/day for age greater than 6 months.</li>

    Bedwetting, also known as nocturnal enuresis, is common in

    has been previously continent and then starts bedwetting again,
    psychological stress is the most likely cause. Stressors such as
    starting a new school, changes in the family dynamic, or a recent

  <p>Diabetes mellitus, spina bifida, a urinary tract infection, and posterior urethral valves can also cause bedwetting in children, but these conditions are less likely given the child's history of previously being continent.
