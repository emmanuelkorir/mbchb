### Question 24

Which of the following is NOT a true reason why children are more vulnerable to air pollution?

Select one:

a. They have more permeable lung epithelium

b. They are more likely to inhale larger air particles due to their rapid breathing rate

c. They are less likely to breathe through the mouth and bypass nasal filtration mechanisms

d. They have narrower airways which are more prone to irritation and inflammation

e. They have a longer life expectancy so suffer cumulative health effects of air pollution

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

c. They are less likely to breathe through the mouth and bypass nasal filtration mechanisms

Their short stature results in them breathing in more particulate matter closer to the ground. 
 
Airway structure. Their airways are narrower and smaller. Also have relatively more mucous glands and increased secretions. Thus, irritation and oedema cause  proportionately greater airway obstruction.  

Airway mucosa is less tightly adherent and have fewer interalveolar pores in infants thus increased risk of hyperinflation.  

Behavior. Increased exposure to indoor pollutants - small children spend most time inside. Cannot take protective measures and rely on adults. Older children spend more time outside playing.

</details>

### Question 25

Which of the following is NOT an element of community case management in child health?

Select one:

a. Treating pneumonia with amoxicillin

b. Referral for severe/complicated cases

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

e. Treating malaria with IV Quinine

CCM is treating people at the community level. 

IV is administered at the hospital.  

Community Case Management (CCM) is an equity focused strategy to improve access  to essential treatment services for children. It involves training, supporting, and  supplying community health workers (CHWs) to assess, classify and manage sick  children with limited access to care at health facilities, in their communities. This is  especially important for illnesses like diarrhoea, malaria, pneumonia which are the  leading causes of death in children (<5years) in developing countries.

c. Ensuring adolescents have access to age-appropriate services

d. Ensuring delivery by skilled birth attendants

e. Reducing infant mortality

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

c. Ensuring adolescents have access to age-appropriate services

(IMNCI) strategy is described as an integrated approach to child  health that focuses on the well-being of the whole child.  

It can be defined as a systematic approach to children's health which focuses on the  whole child. This means focusing not only on curative care but also on prevention of  disease. The approach was developed by the United Nations Children's Fund in 1995.  ∙ IMNCI is considered better than single-condition approaches  

The IMNCI strategy includes three main components:  Improving case management skills of healthcare staff. Improving the health systems. Improving family and community health practices.  

In health facilities (component 1 and 2), the IMNCI strategy: Promotes the accurate identification of childhood illnesses in out-patient settings  o Ensures appropriate combined treatment of all major illnesses. Strengthens the counselling of caregivers. Speeds up the referral of severely ill children.  

In the home setting (component 3), IMNCI: Promotes appropriate care-seeking behaviors. Helps to improve nutrition and preventative care, and supports the correct implementation of prescribed care.
