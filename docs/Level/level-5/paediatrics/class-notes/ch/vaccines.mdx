# Immunization Program in Kenya

Vaccine: Suspension of weakened, killed, or fragmented microorganisms or toxins or other biological preparation, such as those consisting of antibodies, lymphocytes, or messenger RNA (mRNA), that is administered primarily to prevent disease. 

A vaccine can confer active immunity against a specific harmful agent by stimulating the immune system to attack the agent. 

A vaccine may also confer passive immunity by providing antibodies or lymphocytes already made by an animal or human donor.

Vaccination: The process/act of introducing a vaccine into the body to produce protection against a specific disease 

Vaccine efficacy: Measured in a controlled clinical trial

Based on how many people who got vaccinated developed the  disease compared with how many people who got the placebo (dummy vaccine) developed the same.

Vaccine potency: Refers to its ability to induce an appropriate immune response.

Immunization: Process whereby a person is made immune or resistant to an infectious disease typically by the administration of a vaccine.

### National Coverage 

Full vaccination 80% KDHS 2022

No vaccination 2% KDHS 2022

### Missed Opportunities in Immunization

Any contact with health services by a child (or adult) who is eligible for vaccination, which does not result in the person receiving all vaccine doses for which he or she is eligible. 

Reasons for Missed Opportunities

A study conducted to assess missed opportunities for vaccination in Kenyan health facilities, in 10 geographically diverse counties, 2016:

### National Immunization Days

NIDs are selected days when measles and polio vaccines as well as vitamin A supplements are given to children between the ages of 0 – 59 months.

These are extra doses given to supplement, not replace the doses received according to routine immunizations.

The aim is to catch unimmunized and partially immunized children and boost the immunized.

- World Polio day - 24th october
- World Hepatitis day - 28th July
- National Measles day - 16th March
