# Pneumonia

The WHO defines pneumonia as a form of acute respiratory infection that affects the lungs. 

When an individual has pneumonia, the alveoli are filled with pus and fluid, which makes breathing painful and limits oxygen intake.

Pneumonia has also been defined as an inflammation of the alveoli in the lung most commonly caused by infections: viruses,bacteria and fungi

Some of the common causes of viral pneumonia are influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).

A common cause of bacterial pneumonia is Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus).

It is the second leading cause of mortality children under the age of 5  in Kenya,at 14% .

### Classification of Pneumonia

Pneumonia can be classified both anatomically and on the basis of the aetiology.

Anatomical classification : 

Pneumonias can  either be localized, with the whole of one or more lobes affected (lober pneumonia) , or 

Diffuse, when they primarily affect the lobules of the lung, often in association with the bronchi and bronchioles - a condition referred to as 'bronchopneumonia'.

#### Aetiological Agents

According to the causative agents, such as Mycoplasma, Legionella, Chlamydia and Coxiella burnetii.

##### Clinical Features

The clinical presentation varies according to the immune state of the patient and the infecting agent. 

In the most common type of pneumonia caused by Strep. Pneumoniae there is often a preceding history of a viral infection. 

Symptoms: 

High grade fever

Pleuritic chest pain 

Dry cough. A day or two later, rusty-colored sputum is produced and may develop labial herpes simplex. 

Signs: 

High temperature (up to 39.5°C)  

Rapid and shallow breathing 

Reduce chest movement on affected side and other signs of lung consolidation such as bronchial breath sounds


#### Complications of Pneumonia

- Respiratory system
- Pleural effusion 
- Empyema
- Pneumatoceles
- Septic emboli in pulmonary veins
- These complications are more common with staph and klebseilla pneumoniaii. 
- Systemic
- Heart failure
- Distant infections such as septicemia , meningitis, pericarditis and osteomyelitis among others

#### Management

Indications for admission 

Oxygen saturation <93%, severe tachypnoea and difficulty in breathing, grunting, apnoea, not feeding or family unable to provide appropriate care.  

supportive care

oxygen for hypoxia 

analgesia if there is pain. 

Intravenous fluids should be given to correct dehydration and maintain adequate hydration and salt balance.  

The choice of antibiotic is determined by;
- the child’s age
- severity of illness
- as suggested by clinical picture & chest x-ray
- according to culture & sensitivity if available.

The choice of antibiotic is determined by;
- the child’s age
- severity of illness
- as suggested by clinical picture & chest X-ray
- according to culture & sensitivity if available.
- Newborns require broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics.
- oral amoxicillin in older infants
- co-amoxiclav is reserved for those who are complicated or unresponsive.

For children >5 years of age, either amoxicillin or oral erythro­mycin is the treatment of choice.
- chest tube drainage or surgical decortication for massive effusion or empyema

### Prognosis

Follow up is not required for children with simple consolidation on chest X¬ray and who recover clinically.

Those with evidence of lobar collapse, atelectasis or empyema should have a repeat chest X¬ray after 4–6 weeks.

### Primary Level Care of Pneumonia

This refers to the first point of medical consultation for patients with pneumonia, provided at a doctor’s office, health center or in the emergency room by a general practitioner or family physician.

This includes; early diagnosis and treatment, reduced exposure to the associated risk factors, and enhanced exposure to the various protective factors. 

The primary level of care for pneumonia include; 
1. Early diagnosis and treatment by a medical professional 
2. Nutrition 
3. Immunization
4. Prevention of comorbidities such as HIV.

### Morbidity

Globally, there are over 1,400 cases of pneumonia per 100,000 children, or 1 case per 71 children every year.

A systematic review and metaanalysis found the pooled prevalence of pneumonia in under-five children in East Africa to be 34% between 2000  to 2019.

Approximately 13% of -pneumonia cases  are severe enough to require hospitalization. Of all the pneumonia cases occurring in countries with high incidence, 8.7% are severe enough to be life threatening.

### Mortality

Pneumonia killed 740 180 children under the age of 5 in 2019, accounting for 14% of all deaths of children under 5 years old but 22% of all deaths in children aged 1 to 5 years.

Half the world's deaths due to pneumonia in children under the age of five years occur in Africa -In sub-Saharan Africa, the estimated proportion of death in children aged below 5 years attributed to pneumonia is 17-26%. 

In 2018, there was a 6 per 1000 live births under 5 mortality rate due to pneumonia; which accounted for 15% of all deaths.This translates to about 9000 children which is more than 1 child per hour.

### Risk Factors

The WHO divided them into definite, likely, and possible risk factors 
- Definite risk factors: Low birth weight / prematurity Lack of immunization with Pneumococcal vaccine, Measles vaccine, Diphtheria Pertussis Tetanus vaccine (DPT)Non-exclusive breastfeeding, Malnutrition Indoor air pollutants, Crowding - defined as more than 5 people per household 
- Likely/probable risk factors: Zinc deficiency, Parental smoking Mother's experience as a caregiver, Concomitant disease such as asthma, diarrhea, heart disease 
- Possible risk factors: Mother's education, Daycare/ School attendance, Rainfall/ Humidity, Vitamin A deficiency, Outdoor air pollution, High altitude (cold air)


### Distribution

Pneumonia is the largest infectious cause of death in children globally.

According to WHO, childhood pneumonia makes  up 14% of all deaths of children under 5 years.

The UNICEF data reports greatest incidence in South Asia (2,500 cases per 100,000 children) and West and Central Africa (1,620 cases per 100,000 children).

Kenya is ranked among the 15 countries with the highest number of deaths due to childhood pneumonia, with a mortality rate of 50.3 per 10,000 children under 5 per year.

## Global Action Plan for the Prevention and control of Pneumonia (GAPP) strategy

The integrated Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhoea (GAPPD) proposes a cohesive approach to ending preventable pneumonia and diarrhoea deaths. 

It brings together critical services and interventions to create healthy environments, promotes practices known to protect children from disease, and ensures that every child has access to proven and appropriate preventive and treatment measures.

#### Purpose	

Provide policy framework and guidance to countries and partners for scaling up interventions in coordinated way	

Propose action steps and programme activities to move forward efficiently	

Build broad coalition of global and national policy-makers, planners, donor agencies and civil societyVision	

Ending preventable child deaths from pneumonia and diarrhoea – 2025

#### Goals for 2025

For children under 5 years of age
- reduce mortality from pneumonia to fewer than 3 per 1000 live births
- reduce mortality from diarrhoea to fewer than 1 per 1000 live births	
- reduce the incidence of severe pneumonia by 75% compared to 2010 levels	
- reduce the incidence of severe diarrhoea by 75% compared to 2010 levels	
- reduce by 40% the global number who are stunted compared to 2010 levels

### Targets:

By the end of 2025:
- 90% full-dose coverage of each relevant vaccine (with 80% coverage in every district)
- 90% access to appropriate pneumonia and diarrhoea case management (with 80% coverage in every district)
- at least 50% coverage of exclusive breastfeeding during the first 6 months of life
- virtual elimination of paediatric HIV

By the end of 2030:
- universal access to basic drinking-water in health care facilities and homes
- universal access to adequate sanitation in health care facilities by 2030 and in homes by 2040
- universal access to handwashing facilities (water and soap) in health care facilities and homes
- universal access to clean and safe energy technologies in health care facilities and homes
