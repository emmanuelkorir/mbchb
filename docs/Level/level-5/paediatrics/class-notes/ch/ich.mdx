# INTERNATIONAL CHILD HEALTH (MDGS, SDGS AND UHC) 

In the year 2000-at the start of the new millennium, the United Nations member states met in New York and agreed on eight areas of global partnership. These eight components of The Millennium Development Goals(MDGs) were targeted to have been achieved by the year 2015.

### STATUS OF MDGs IN KENYA

#### MDG 4-REDUCE CHILD MORTALITY 

4.1.Under Five Year Old Mortality rate      
- Declined from 74/1000 live births in 2009 to 52/1000 live births in 2014. This is short of the target by 20/1000 live births.(KDHS,2014)

4.2. Infant Mortality Rate 
- In 2005,Kenya's IMR was 60/1000 live births. In 2014 it was 39/1000.Despite the positive trajectory, Kenya had not hit its target rate of 22/1000 live births by the end of 2015.(KDHS,2014)

4.3. Proportion of 1 year old children immunized against Measles  
- The immunization of 1 year olds against Measles rose from 76.7% in 2005 to 85% in 2009 then rising to 96.7% in 2014 thus surpassing the set target of 88%.(KDHS,2014)

#### MDG 5- Improve Maternal Health

MDG 5- has 2 targets. 
- 1- To reduce by three-quarters the maternal mortality ratio
- 2- Achieve universal access to reproductive health

Maternal mortality has reduced from approximately 708/100,000 live births in 2000 to 362/100,000 live births in 2014

Birth attendants done by skilled health professionals have increased from 42.9% in 2000 to 62% in 2014.

#### MDG 6- Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other disease

Status of MDG 6 in Kenya

MDG 6 assessed 4 factors in relation to HIV/AIDS
- HIV prevalence among the population aged 15-24 years
- Condom use at high-risk sex
- Proportion of population aged 15-24 with comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS
- Proportion of adults population with advanced HIV infection with access to ARV drugs

## SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS

In 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals were developed by the United Nations.

SDG’s are a sustainable development agenda that listed 17 goals to be achieved by 2030.

SDG’s are an international call to action for all countries (developing and developed) to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure a peaceful and prosperous world for us and future generations.

### UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE(UHC)

According to WHO, UHC means that all people have access to the full range of quality health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship.

It covers the full continuum of essential health services, from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care.

The 3 domains of UHC are;Service delivery, health financing and governance interrelated health systems policy areas and actions.

#### DESCRIBE THE 3 DOMAINS OF UHC

1. SERVICE DELIVERY

Quality service delivery that is comprehensive,inclusive and sufficient.
- Expanding frontline services, particularly primary health care
- Scaling up investment in skilled health workers Improving access to medicines and health technologies
- Innovating to meet the health needs of vulnerable and marginalized groups
- Expanding engagement with non-state providers Improving patient safety and quality of health services
- Implementing International Health Regulations and service delivery models that promote resilience
- Fostering multi-sectoral action to address the social determinants of health
- The current situation is that there is 1 physician for every 6500 people, and 1 nurse/midwife for every 1250.
- This is way below the 43 physicians per 10,000 in the west.

2. HEALTH FINANCING
-  Mobilizing resources through progressive taxation and prioritising health, within a sustainable macroeconomic framework
-  Expanding pooling arrangements to improve financial protection for all
-  Strategic purchasing to increase efficiency of health spending, with a focus on public goods and public health

3. GOVERNANCE AND ACCESIBILITY
- Fostering citizens’ platforms and people’s voice mechanisms
- Promoting freedom of information and expanded use of quality data
- Adopting legal frameworks supporting access to quality health services
- Developing policy dialogue platforms for multi-sectoral action
- Promoting regional and global mechanisms for collective action and partnership
- Strengthening research and development, including technology transfer mechanisms.

3 important aspects of accessibility should be considered; financial, geographical and cultural. These considerations would tailor the services to the communities targeted.

GOVERNANCE

1.86%(62.3 billion Kshs.) of the National budget for 2022/2023 was allocated to healthcare. The table below highlights the amount each sub -sector was allocated

#### FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE UHC

- Health education
- Demography
- Skilled health workforce
- Governance
- Allocation of resources to health sector
- Infrastructure
- Windows of opportunity
- Engaging people and communities to take an active role in their health
- Innovative partnerships between public and public sectors in health care delivery
