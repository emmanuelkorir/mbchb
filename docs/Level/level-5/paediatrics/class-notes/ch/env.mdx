# Environmental Health and Children II (Water Supply & Environmental Sanitation)

Water sources include;
- Surface water including lakes, rivers, streams and ponds.
- Ground water including springs, boreholes,deep and shallow wells.
- Rain water which is collected directly.
- Surface water from taps or pipes which includes water from local surface water and municipal treatment plants.
- Source, Type & Quantity of Water

## Types of Water

1. Improved Water

Improved water sources are defined as those that are protected from outside contamination, particularly from faecal matter . 

Examples include household connections, public standpipes, boreholes, protected dug wells, protected springs and rainwater collection. 

2. Unimproved water

Unimproved water sources include unprotected wells, unprotected springs, surface water (e.g. river, dam or lake), vendor-provided water, bottled water (unless water for other uses is available from an improved source) and tanker truck-provided water.

The WHO reports that a person needs 50-100 litres of water daily to meet their personal needs and maintain optimum health.

These include drinking water, washing , sanitation, cooking, hygiene and household cleaning.

WHO defines safe water as water that is free from harmful levels of microbial, chemical, physical and radiological contaminants and is accessible to all individuals and communities without discrimination.
Quantity of Water

WHO/UNICEF joint monitoring programme recommends that all households have access to basic drinking-water services, defined as accessing water from an improved source, provided that collection time is not more than 30 minutes for a roundtrip, including queuing.

### Quantity of Water

#### Water Accessibility Categories

Levels of water access determined by accessibility:

- Inadequate access: Water collection time is 30 minutes or more with a distance of more than 1 kilometer. Hygiene is compromised due to low quantity of water.

- Basic access: Collection time is 5- 30 minutes with a distance of between 100 metres -1 kilometer. Hygiene is also compromised. Quantity is approximately 20 litres per person per day.

- Intermediate access: Collection time of about 5 minutes with a distance of 100 metres. Water is provided by one tap and is approximately 50 litres per person per day. Quantity is sufficient for hygiene purposes but insufficient incase of disease outbreak.

- Optimal access: Supply is from multiple taps within the household approximately 100 litres per person per day.

### Domestic Water Treatment Methods

They can be classified into:

1. Physical Water Treatment

This includes boiling, filtration, sedimentation,solar water disinfection

2. Chemical Water Treatment

Use of chemicals such as chlorine and flocculation

1. Boiling

Clear water is brought to a rolling boil for 1 minute (at elevations above 6,500 feet, boil for 3 minutes), allowed to cool before use and stored in a clean, sanitized containers with tight covers.This is effective in killing most disease causing pathogens.

2. Filtration

Water is manually pumped through a filtration device which could be a cloth, sand filtration device. Effective in filtering protozoa but not as effective with bacteria and viruses.

3. Sedimentation

This is the separation of small particles and sediment from water. The 3 pot method is an example of this.

4. Solar water disinfection

Solar disinfection works by placing contaminated water in a clean transparent container and exposing it to strong sunlight for 6 to 8 hours if sunny, or 2 days (if cloudy).This method is most appropriate when access to clear clean transparent containers for treatment is available.

#### Chemical Methods

1. Chlorination

Chlorination is a disinfection technique that involves adding a chlorine-based product such as sodium hypochlorite, calcium hypochlorite, or household bleach to water to kill bacteria and viruses. Other chemical disinfectants, such as iodine and chlorine dioxide, can also be effective for disinfecting water. A common example is Waterguard .Effectiveness is maximal when combined with filtration. It is effective against most organisms.

2. Flocculation

Flocculation-disinfection is a water treatment process where a flocculant such as ferric sulfate and a disinfectant such as calcium hypochlorite  is added to water and solids form larger clusters, or flocs, that can be removed from the water.This is most effective when water is turbid.

#### Urban & Rural Coverage with Water in Kenya 

Water supply in Kenya is characterised by low levels of access to water, in particular in urban slums and in rural areas, as well as poor service quality in the form of intermittent water supply.

Growing water demand and water scarcity have turned into a notable challenge in Kenya.

Climate change, population growth, urbanization, water pollution, and poor management of water resources have aggravated the issue of the water crisis

Estimates from the JMP show that 58% of Kenyans(~27.2 million Kenyans) had access to at least basic drinking water sources in 2015.(83% in urban areas and 50% in rural areas)

The total number of people lacking access to at least basic clean water in 2015 was ~19.7 million people

Urban & Rural Coverage with Water in Kenya ~3 in 5 Kenyans had access to basic drinking water in 2015 

### Personal Hygiene

WHO defines Hygiene as actions that help in maintaining & promoting health as well as preventing spread of diseases. 

Therefore personal hygiene are actions involved in maintaining cleanliness of the body.

#### Hand Washing involves soap and water.

A basic but an essential element of infection control.

Educating mothers and children on the right techniques and when to practice hand washing is key in Infection prevention and control. 

A study conducted in Harar, Ethiopia reported hand washing with soap and water reduced diarrheal illness by 28-48% and respiratory infection by 20-50%

Handwashing should be before breastfeeding, after visiting the toilet, before and after meals.

Bathing - Necessary in preventing common childhood skin diseases such as eczema, trachoma, scabies. Children need supervision during bathing to ensure adequate washing. Regular baths with the use of mild soap and drying using a clean towel should be encouraged.

Waste - This is a product or substance that is no longer suited for its intended use.

### Waste & Refuse Disposal

Refuse - Refers to any disposable materials which includes both recyclable and non- recyclable materials.

Waste management encompassess; collection, transport, processing, recycling, disposal and monitoring of waste material.

1. Recycling is the direct reuse of used products and material recycling is the recovery of raw materials from waste.

2. Incineration is the process of burning waste to convert it into incombustible matter such as ash and gas.

3. Composting involves breaking down organic waste material into nutrient-rich soil.

4. Latrines can be ordinary or ventilated improved latrines.

An improved toilet/latrine facility - hygienically separates human excreta from human contact. It includes:
flush or pour-flush toilets to piped sewer system, septic tank, ventilated Improved Pit (VIP) latrine; pit latrine with slab; composting toilet

An unimproved toilet/latrine facility - does not ensure a hygienic separation of human excreta from human contact. It includes: 
pit latrines without slabs or platforms or open pit, hanging/bucket latrines, open defecation in fields, forests, bushes, bodies of water or other open spaces.

Pit latrines - the most common methods of waste disposal in Kenya (74% usage). 

Absence - leads to practices like open defecation and flying toilets eg in Kibera

#### Latrine Coverage & Use In Kenya

It is a crucial factor, given how closely it is related to preventing under 5 child mortalities

WHO and IRC, 2003, Linking technology choice with operation and maintenance in the context of community water supply and sanitation: A reference document for planners and project staff
They consist of a pit dug in the ground and a cover slab or floor above the hole (Figure 20.1). Pit latrines must have a cleanable cover slab in order to be considered as improved sanitation systems. The excreta (both faeces and urine) drop through the hole to enter the dry pit. Pit latrines should be constructed on a slight mound so they are higher than the surrounding ground and water at the surface will flow away from the hole. They should also have a lid that can be placed over the hole to reduce problems with flies and odours. They may have a squat pan or a raised footrest to make using the latrine more convenient. The pit is often lined but the bottom remains open, allowing the liquid to drain into the soil and leaving the solids behind.

According to the KDHS 2014, 25% of households use an improved toilet facility that is not shared with other household (26% urban dwellers and 21% rural dwellers).

The most common type of toilet facility in rural areas is an open pit latrine 66%

43% of urban dwellers shared an improved toilet facility with >2 households compared to 12% of rural dwellers

17.5% still uses the unimproved sources to dispose human waste, causing increased water pollution and fecal oral disease transmissions.

An estimated 14% of Kenyans practice open defecation. 

Kenya aims to achieve 100% open defecation free status by 2030 as per SDG 6 (achieve access and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all)

### Environmental Hygiene

Environment - according to WHO (1995) is all that which is external to individual human host. It can be divided into physical, biological, social cultural any or all of which can influence health status in populations.

Hygiene - The science of health and the practise of cleanliness that promotes good health and well being.

Environmental hygiene is a branch of public health that is concerned with control of all those factors in man’s surroundings or physical environment which may have deleterious effect on human health and well being.

It encompasses effective cleaning of surfaces using appropriate products, decontamination of medical equipment and devices used in patient-care procedures, safe and appropriate handling of sharps, blood and body fluid spills, waste and linen. 

Kenya is one of 26 countries globally that are responsible for 90 per cent of the world’s open defecation. 

Open defecation has particularly devastating effects on the health of children under 5, especially in rural areas where the practice is more prevalent.

In Kenya, over 6,600 children under five are estimated to die each year from diarrhoea, of which 80% are attributable to poor water, sanitation and hygiene.

World Health Organization (WHO) indicates that diarrhea is the second leading cause of death in children under five 

A significant proportion of diarrhoeal disease can be prevented through safe drinking-water and adequate sanitation and hygiene.

## Diseases Whose Prevalence Are Influenced By Poor Water Supply & Poor Environmental Sanitation

Diseases influenced by poor water supply and poor environmental sanitation are categorized into 5 broad categories according to Bradley Classification:

1. Water-borne diseases
2. Water-washed diseases
3. Water-based diseases
4. Water-related diseases
5. Water-dispersed diseases

### 1. Water-Borne Disease

Caused by ingestion of water contaminated by human or animal or urine containing pathogens. Includes:

Indeterminate diarrheal disease

Main cause of diarrhea in children under 5 - rotaviruses, pathogenic E.coli, campylobacter jejuni, protozoan parasites( Giardia lamblia)

Epidemic diarrheal disease- shigellosis, cholera

Non-diarrheal diseases- typhoid fever, hepatitis, polio, leptospirosis

Can be controlled by improving the quality of water used for drinking and cooking

### 2. Water-Washed Disease

Caused by inadequate use of water for domestic and personal hygiene.

Includes: 

Soil transmitted helminths- hookworm, whipworm, ascaris lumbricoides

Acute respiratory infections including pneumonia

Skin and eye diseases- trachoma, ringworm

Flea, lice, mite and tick-borne diseases

They can be controlled by increasing the quantity of water, rather than the quality

### 3. Water-Based Disease

Caused by spread of organisms that develop in water and become parasites

Some of the parasitic pathogens can also be found in aquatic host e.g snails and fish 

Includes : schistosomiasis, dracunculiasis (guinea-worm disease)

Controlled by avoiding direct contact with contaminated water and wearing protective clothing e.g. use of barrier methods such as gumboots

### 4. Water-Related Disease

Caused by insect vectors which need water to breed

Includes:

Mosquito-borne diseases- malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, filariasis

Fly-borne diseases - onchocerciasis, trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis

Can be controlled by draining stagnant water, clearing marshes and swamps

### 5. Water-Dispersed Disease

Caused by organisms that proliferate in warm water and infect the host through the respiratory tract

Example - Legionella pneumophila

Can be controlled by using terminal tap water filters
