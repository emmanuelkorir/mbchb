# GROWTH MONITORING (PRINCIPLES OF ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASUREMENT-PLOTTING AND INTERPRETATION)

Growth: irreversible, constant increase in the body size due to increased number and size of cells. Often quantitative.
Development- gradual increase in the complexity of a child (with acquisition of skills and capacity to function) which follows an orderly pattern focused towards enhancing survival resulting from differentiation and maturation of cells of the CNS.
Anthropometry- derived from greek words ‘anthropos’ meaning man and ‘metron’ meaning measurement. It is therefore the science of measuring the size, proportions and gross composition of the human body comparing them to the set standards (WHO 2006 growth charts).
The anthropometric measurements commonly used for children include: weight, length/height, mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) and head circumference.  
Growth monitoring- regular measurement of a child’s weight and sometimes height, documentation on a growth chart and interpreting the growth pattern to allow for specific interventions in case of abnormalities. This is done while also comparing them to the set standards(WHO 2006 growth charts).

Principles of Growth
Cephalocaudal principle- development that follows a head-to-toe progression for instance head control before rolling, sitting and standing.
Proximodistal principle- development proceeds from the center of the body going outwards for example, the proximal parts of the the limbs grows first before the distal muscles. 
Orthogenetic principle- development of simple tasks begins before the complex ones for instance scribbling before drawing a perfect circle.


Weight
Important component of growth monitoring in paediatrics
Usually measured in kilograms to the nearest 
0.01kg for infants 
0.1kg for older children
Various types of weighing scale:	
UNISCALE (Made by UNICEF)
A taring scale
Electronic baby scale
Pediatric beam scale
WHO recommends a scale that is:
Solidly built & durable
Electronic (digital reading)  
Measures  to a precision of 0.1 kg (100g) & up to 150 kg
Allows tared weighing 
Bathroom scales & hanging scales are not recommended

Weight indicates the nutrition & health status of an individual. “Tared weighing” means that the scale can be re-set to zero (“tared”) with the person just weighed still on it reduces the risk of error (no need to subtract weights to determine the child’s weight alone). Bathroom scales are not recommended as they tend to be unreliable. Hanging scales are also not reliable when weighing agitated babies. 

Weight
Weech’s formula can be used to estimate the expected weight
At birth, 
expected weight in kg = 2.5kg to 4.0kg
At 3 - 12 months, 
expected weight in kg = (age in months + 9) / 2
At 1 - 6 years, 
expected weight in kg = (age in years x 2) + 8
At 7 -12 years, 
expected weight in kg = (age in years x 7 – 5) / 2

Procedure to Measure Weight
Explain to the mother the reasons & procedure for weighing the child
Place the scale on a hard, flat surface
Make sure there is enough light to read the display on the scale
Place protective tissue paper
For children less than 2 years or those unable to stand:
Use a scale with a taring feature such as a pantype weighing scale
Make sure none of the body parts are hanging out of the pan
Make sure the child is not holding on anything outside
Take 3 measurements and calculate the average
For children older than 2 years and can stand: 
Use a digital platform scale, electronic standing scale

A scale with a taring feature
Adapted from UNICEF-WHO
Explain to the mother the reasons for weighing the child, for example, to see how the child is growing, how the child is recovering from a previous illness, or how the child is responding to changes that have been made in his feeding or care. 

Digital Platform Scale Weighing Procedure
Explain the procedure to the mother and the child 
Turn on the digital scale and zero the scale
Request the mother to help undress the child’s outer clothings and shoes
Ask the child to stand in the middle of the scale and to remain still
Record’s the child’s weight to the nearest 0.1kg
Gently help the child to get off the scale
A digital platform scale
Image adapted from DHS
 Talk with the child about the need to stand still. Communicate with the child in a sensitive, non-frightening way. Ask the child to stand in the middle of the scale, feet slightly apart (on the footprints, if marked), and to remain still until the weight appears on the display.

Common Errors
Weighing in excess clothing and shoes
An agitated or uncooperative child
Failure to balance scale at zero before each use
Misreading the scale
An infant with excessive clothing

Length/Height
This refers to the crown to heel measurement to the nearest 0.1 cm (1mm)
For infants and children < 2 years old, the supine length is measured using an infantometer while for children above 2 years, the height is measured using a stadiometer. Alternatively, a cut-off point of 87 cm can be used if the age is not known/difficult to assess(If <87cm,use an infantometer)
If the child is less than 2yrs and cannot be measured in a recumbent position, the height is measured and then 0.7cm is added. If the child is 2 yrs or older but cannot stand, measure recumbent length and subtract 0.7cm (standing height is 0.7 cm less than recumbent length)
The normal length at birth is 50± 2 cm.
Nutritional deficiencies can be reflected by low height for age(stunting) while increased height could be linked to endocrine disorders.

(

Procedure for measuring length using an infantometer
The child is placed lying down flat along the middle of the board with both the measurer and the assistant on their knees.
The assistant positions the child’s head firmly touching the fixed headboard while making sure the hair is compressed and the eyes are looking straight up (draw a line from the auditory canal to the corner of the eye and this should be at an angle of 90º with the board).
The measurer places their hands on the child’s legs to stretch them and then holds the knees with one hand to prevent flexion.
The measurer then uses the other hand to slide the foot plate and push it firmly against the bottom of the child’s feet such that the soles are flat against the board with toes facing upwards.
The length is then read from the tape attached to the board and recorded to the nearest 0.1cm.


Procedure for measuring height using a stadiometer
The stadiometer is fixed upright on level ground
The child stands upright on the fixed baseboard in the middle of the measuring board.
With both the measurer and the assistant on their knees, the heels and knees of the child are held firmly against the board by the assistant.
The child’s occiput, shoulder blades, buttocks and the posterior aspects of the calves and heels should all be against the board with the shoulders level 
Ensure the child is looking straight ahead (draw a line from the auditory canal to the corner of the eye and this should be at an angle of 90º with the board) and with the hands loosely by their side.
The measurer’s left hand should be on the child’s chin to keep it steady while the other hand pulls the headboard down to rest firmly on top of the head and compress the hair.
The height is then read and recorded to the last completed 0.1cm.


Possible sources of error 
The child/infant not being positioned correctly
A reading taken from the wrong angle or plane  ( Parallax error)
A measurement taken with the shoes/socks/headgear on
Values that are wrongly recorded
Expected  Height for Age 


The most common age based formulae for height estimation in children is the Nelson-Wheech formula which is:
 (Age in years X 6) + 77

MID-UPPER ARM CIRCUMFERENCE (MUAC)
It is one of the rapid nutritional anthropometric assessment methods.
MUAC is useful for children aged between 6-59 months. Can also be used for adults but has different cut-offs.
It is a used as a screening tool for malnutrition.
MUAC can be reliably used as an alternative nutritional status indicator especially if it is difficult to take the weight and height measurements for assessing wasting.
When plotted on a child’s growth curve, MUAC-for-age reflects body fat relative to the chronological age of the child.


MUAC Measurement Procedure
Perform hand hygiene
Expose the child’s left (non-dominant) hand.
With the elbow flexed to 90 degrees, locate the shoulder tip and the tip of the olecranon process. Place one end of the tape (0cm) at the tip of the shoulder and the other past the bent elbow. Use the distance between the tips to determine the mid-arm and with the permission of the mother, mark it using a finger or a pen. When measuring, ensure the MUAC tape is straight.
Straighten the hand  and encircle the child’s non-dominant arm with the MUAC tape exactly at the level that was marked ensuring that it is not too tight or too loose.
Take the reading through the window and at the arrow, noting the color and record the reading to one decimal place in cm.

MUAC Measurement Procedure

Interpretation of MUAC
Severity of Acute Malnutrition
MUAC Measurement (cm)
None
≥13.5
At Risk
12.5 to 13.4
Moderate
11.5 to 12.4
Severe 
˂11.5

Common Errors when taking MUAC
Inaccurate determination of the mid-arm position.
Using the dominant hand (right hand) rather than the non-dominant hand (left arm) for the measurement.
Tightening the MUAC tape too much around the patient’s arm.
Taking a measurement when the MUAC tape is too loose.
Inaccurate reading and recording.



Head Circumference 
It refers to the measurement of a child’s head around its widest area
This distance is measured from about 1-2 fingers above the eyebrows around to the widest part of the back of the head. 
The head circumference is routinely measured up to 36 months and is indicative of the child’s brain size. 
A child’s brain size at birth is about 25% of an adult with an average head circumference of 35cm. 
Generally, the head circumference increases by 2cm/month for the first 3 months, 1cm/month between 3-6 months, 0.5cm/month between 6-12 months and 3.5cm between 12-36 months. 
Therefore, children attain 75% of adult head size by 1 years, 80% by 3 years and 90% by 7 years 


Head circumference 
Defective head circumference may either be microcephaly or macrocephaly. 


Defect 
Causes 
Microcephaly (small head): Head circumference of greater than 2SD below the mean for the age and sex.
 
Infections during pregnancy such as rubella, toxoplasmosis and cytomegalovirus, and severe malnutrition; Fetal alcohol syndrome; Genetic disorders (Down Syndrome)
Macrocephaly (big head): Head circumference greater than 2SD above the mean for the age and sex
Hydrocephalus, infections such as meningitis and encephalitis, and genetic disorders such as achondroplasia; Metabolic syndromes

Procedure for measuring head circumference 

Procedure for measuring head circumference 
Use a device that cannot be stretched, for instance a flexible plastic tape measure. 
Snugly wrap the tape measure around the widest possible circumference to include the most prominent part of the forehead (about 1-2 fingers above the eyebrows), above the ears around to the occipital protuberance at the back of the head.
Remeasure 3 times and take the largest measurement
Compare the measurement to the WHO head circumference chart for age and sex. 





Common errors while measuring the head circumference 
Wrong placement of the tape measure for example, over the ears, below the occipital protuberance and loose tape
Difference in hair growth and volume
Lack of patient cooperation
Use of wrong charts during interpretation for instance, wrong chart for age or sex

Wasting
Wasting is defined as low weight for height. 
It’s an indicator of recent and severe weight loss either due to a lack of adequate quality and quantity of food or an acute illness.
Well nourished child: +2 SD to -1 SD
    At Risk : -1 SD to -2 SD
Moderate: -3 SD to -2 SD (Wasted)
Severe Wasting: Below -3 SD



Stunting
Defined as a low height or length for age
It’s the most frequent form of undernutrition among young children
It’s an indicator of chronic undernutrition either due to prolonged food deprivation or a chronic illness.
Not Stunted: >-2 SD to < +2 SD
Moderate: >-3 SD to < -2 SD 
Severe Stunting: Below -3 SD



Underweight
Defined as low weight for age
 Not underweight: >-2SD to <+2SD for the median
 Moderately underweight - weight for age <- 2 SD and >-3SD for the median 
 Severely underweight - weight for age <-3SD of the children.
On its own, underweight cannot be used as a sign for chronic or acute malnutrition. Therefore, when a child is underweight, it is necessary to check their height for age (stunting) and weight for length/height (wasting).


Overweight and obesity 
Overweight in U5- Weight for length/ height or BMI for age >2SD and ≤3SD for the median5-19 yrs- BMI for age > 1SD above the WHO reference median
Obesity refers to weight for length/height or BMI for age >3SD of the median in U55-19 years- BMI for age >2 SD above the WHO growth reference median.Overweight and obesity are mainly caused by non nutritious diets and limited physical activity.Prevalence – 6% of U5 are overweight and 18% of children aged 5-18 are overweight, translating to 380 million children globally
