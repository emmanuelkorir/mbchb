# Public Health Programs for Child Health (Diarrhea)

WHO defines diarrhea as the passage of three or more loose or liquid stool per day.

Frequent passing of formed stool is not diarrhea.

Passage of pasty stool by breastfed babies is not diarrhea.

It is a symptom that points to infection in the gastrointestinal tract.

There are three clinical types of diarrhea:

Acute watery diarrhea: Lasts several hours or days but less than 14 days (cholera)

Acute bloody diarrhea/dysentery

Persistent diarrhea which lasts 14 days or longer

Chronic Diarrhea: more than 1 month

Diarrhea: Assessment of Dehydration

## Primary level care of diarrhea

The primary level care of diarrhea encompasses approaches in preventing, identifying and managing early diarrheal illness.  

The primary prevention of diarrhea aimed at reducing transmission of the infective agent to otherwise healthy children include:-

Observing appropriate hand washing technique

Rotavirus and measles vaccines

Providing adequate and safe drinking water

Ensuring proper disposal of human excreta and other waste 


### Primary level care of diarrhea 
- Prevention and treatment of dehydration: ORS and fluids at home
- Continued/increased feeding: Exclusive breastfeeding on demand.
- Zinc supplementation: 10mg (≤6m)/20mg (>6m) daily for 10-14 days
- Vitamin A supplementation: if they haven’t received in the last month
- At ORT corners in health facilities in middle and low income countries such as Africa and Asia, treatment is combined with education.
- The mothers are also given immediate access to ORS and clean water while being educated on hygiene, breastfeeding and nutrition. 

#### Role of diarrhoea on the burden of illness in children in the developing countries

Diarrhoeal disease is the second leading cause of death in children under 5 years old, beyond the neonatal age, contributing to approximately 9% of U5 mortality.(UNICEF 2019)

Each year, 525,000 children under 5 years die due to diarrhoeal disease globally (WHO 2017) and in 2019 alone, 370,000 children died from diarrheal illness.

Diarrhoeal disease accounts for nearly 1.7 billion cases globally (WHO 2017) and the burden of diarrheal mortality is concentrated in low-resource settings.

Children under 3 years of age in the low income countries experience an average of three episodes of diarrhoea per year with each episode depriving the child of necessary nutrition. Diarrhoea is thus a leading cause of malnutrition in children under 5, other than causing dehydration and loss of electrolytes.

### Causes of decreasing trend in diarrheal deaths

Overtime, there is a decreasing trend in deaths due to diarrhea since the 1990s and this has been largely attributed to the following:

Advancement in treatment

Introduction of rotavirus vaccines

Improved nutrition

Improved water, sanitation and hygiene

Despite all these, diarrhea continues to be a major contributor to childhood mortality globally, particularly in LMICs. 

Those living in low and middle-income (LMICs) are disproportionately affected with approximately 90% of diarrheal deaths in children younger than 5 years occurring mainly in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

#### Risk Factors for Diarrhoea Morbidity and Mortality in Children

Unhygienic food preparation and storage processes, 

Poor hygienic practices of the caregiver, including failure to properly wash hands prior with running water and soap.

Poor waste and refuse disposal- for instance landfills near water sources

Unsafe drinking and cooking water. 

Unsafe domestic water storage and handling processes.

Lack of improved sanitation facilities such as ventilated-improved pit latrines

Malnutrition- such children are more vulnerable to diarrhoea, and each diarrhoeal episode worsened the malnutrition.

Failure to receive the rotavirus vaccine, measles vaccine

Failure to exclusively breastfeed for the first 6 months of life

Lack of health education on how infections spread

### DISTRIBUTION OF DIARRHEAL DISEASES IN CHILDREN 

Diarrhoea is a leading killer of children, accounting for approximately 9 per cent of all deaths among children under age 5 worldwide in 2019 with the most burden in Sub Saharan Africa and South Asia.

Children between 6–23 months were associated with the highest risk of diarrhoea. Every year, there is an estimated number of 1.7 billion cases of diarrhoea amongst children under five years.

WHO estimates that every year, around 525,000 children under five years die due to diarrhoeal disease.In Kenya, during the year 2018, 1,499,146 cases of diarrhea were reported among children under five years.

Kenya ranks 10th in the worst hit countries by childhood diarrhoea.

A study showed that in 2017, 25.6% of children living in Nairobi Informal Settlement had diarrhoea.

In Kenya, 14%  of children <5 years experienced diarrhea

57% sought advice/treatment, 48% received ORS, 40% - Zinc, 32% ORS + Zn, 26% ORS + Zn + continued feeding

Care seeking for children with diarrhea almost similar for rural and urban residences (KDHS 2022)

Children between 6–11 (26.6%) and 12–23(24.7%) months had the greatest risk of diarrhoea compared to chidren in other age cohorts. (KDHS 2014)

Sex, relationship of primary caregiver, number of people and children in households statistically significant  in diarrheal prevalence of <5

Diarrheal prevalence higher in households with high number of people as well as high number of children <5 years

Low income households have an average 3 diarrheal episodes annually (WHO)

Sociodemographic characteristics of children with diarrhea (KDHS 2014)

### Control Measures	

Control measures proposed by the integrated Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhoea (GAPPD)  are:

##### Prevention measures such as:	
- Vaccination against Measles and Rotavirus
- Safe drinking water for cooking and cleaning such as piped water
- Proper sanitation and disposal of fecal matter
- Handwashing with soap and water
- HIV prevention

##### Control Measures

Protective measures such as:
- Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months
- Adequate complementary feeding
- Vitamin micronutrient supplementation (Vitamin A, Zinc)
- Therapeutic measures such as:
- Improved care seeking and referral 
- Case management at the health facility and community level
- Continued feeding (including breastfeeding)
- Supplies: low-osmolarity ORS, zinc

##### 7 Point Plan	on Diarrhoea 
- UNICEF and WHO recommends the 7-point plan which consists of 5 prevention and 2 treatment strategies:
- Rotavirus and measles vaccinations
- Promotion of early and exclusive breastfeeding and vitamin A supplementation
- Promotion of handwashing with soap and water
- Improved water supply quantity and quality, including treatment and safe household water storage
- Community wide sanitation
- Treatment package consists of:
- Fluid replacement to prevent dehydration
- Zinc treatment
