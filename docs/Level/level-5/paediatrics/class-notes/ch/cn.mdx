# Public Health Programs for Child Health (Care of the Newborn)

## Mothers Health

According to WHO maternal health is the mother’s health during pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period.

In Kenya, the maternal mortality ratio stands at 530 per 100,000 live births(WHO,2021) which is higher than the global MM ratio that is 223 per 100,000 live births (WHO, 2021).

SDG Target 3.1 aims to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030, and Kenya still has a long way to go to achieve this target.

#### Changes during pregnancy

Anatomical changes include:
- An exaggerated lumbar lordosis, downward movement of the shoulders and forward flexion of the neck.
- Widening and increased mobility of sacroiliac joints and pubic symphisis.
- Hydronephrosis and hydroureter due to hormonal effects, external compression and intrinsic changes in the ureteral wall.
- Spider nevi and palmar erythema seen due to raised oestrogen levels.
- Hyperpigmentation and striae gravidarum are also seen.
- Cephalad displacement of the stomach.
- Decrease in the tone of Lower Oesophageal Sphincter manifesting as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease of pregnancy.

Physiological changes include:
- Increased peripheral vasodilatation,
- Discrepancy in increase in plasma volume (40–50%) and red cell mass (20%) results in physiological anaemia of pregnancy
- Increase in blood volume.
- Increased cardiac output and GFR.
- Hypercoagulable state is experienced.
- inhibition of GI contractile activity by progesterone, oesophageal peristalsis and intestinal transit slow down resulting in constipation
- Increase in LDL cholesterol important for placental steroidogenesis.
- Increased glucose levels that are shunted to the foetus

Common causes of direct maternal injury and death include:
- Hemorrhage 
- Hypertensive disorders
- Sepsis
- Obstructed labour
- Causes of Indirect maternal injury and death include;
- Severe Anemia
- Cardiac disease 
- HIV related disease 
- Renal failure
- Complicated Malaria

### Factors affecting Mother’s Health.

Nutrition

- Before pregnancy, women need nutritious and safe diets to establish sufficient reserves for pregnancy. During pregnancy and breastfeeding, energy and nutrient needs increase and are a requirement for optimal health of both the mother and foetus. Iron and Folic Acid daily supplements are also taken.

Birth spacing

- A minimum of 2 years is recommended to minimise poor birth outcomes and give more time for the mother to recover physically and nutritionally between births.

Access to health services.

- Access to proper antenatal care with a minimum of 8 contacts and giving birth with a skilled attendant in a hospital facility improves chances of positive outcomes for both the mother and child. Factors affecting access to health care include availability of services, maternal education levels and accessibility.

Community factors
- Community health infrastructure within communities, availability of health facilities and cultural norms towards the position of women in society  determine womens attitudes towards pregnancy and giving birth as well as levels of autonomy granted to make decisions regarding birth practices.

Lifestyle choices of the mother.
- Lifestyle choices regarding recreational drug use, exercise, sleep, nutritional practices, stress management (eg in regard to the birth of the baby, financial needs of the child,issues of abortion) and regular check ups influence the mothers health.

### RECOMMENDATIONS

- All mothers should receive quality antenatal services and have a minimum of 8 contact during the pregnancy.
- Mothers should receive quality labour and delivery care including  skilled birth attendants and adequate post-natal care.
- Family planning services should be made available to mothers and sufficient education given on the various methods.
- Promotion of strong social support to the mothers.
- Social determinants of health should be addressed such as education and poverty to improve outcomes for mothers at population level.
- Mothers should be supported at the workplace through adequate maternity leave, modified duties and flexible schedules.

### ANC ATTENDANCE

- Antenatal care is important to monitor pregnancy and reduce morbidity and mortality risks for the mother and child during pregnancy, delivery, and the postnatal period
- WHO now recommends a minimum of eight antenatal care contacts to reduce perinatal mortality and to improve women’s experience of care.
- Increases maternal and fetal assessments to detect complications
- Improves communication between health providers and pregnant women
- Increases the likelihood of positive pregnancy outcomes. 
- First contact in the first 12 weeks’ gestation, with subsequent contacts taking place at 20, 26, 30, 34, 36, 38 and 40 weeks’ gestation.

### Importance of ANC

- Learn from about healthy behaviours during pregnancy
- Understand warning signs during pregnancy and childbirth
- Receive social, emotional and psychological support
- Micronutrient supplementation
- Treatment for hypertension to prevent eclampsia
- Immunization against tetanus & diphtheria
- HIV testing and PMTCT of HIV
- Malaria prophylaxis and insecticide-treated mosquito nets

### SERVICES OFFERED DURING ANC

- MCH BOOKLET

### ANC ATTENDANCE IN KENYA (KDHS 2022)

- 98% of women reported receiving antenatal care from a skilled provider for their most recent live birth or stillbirth in the 2-year period before the survey.
- 66% of women had four or more ANC visits for their most recent live birth or stillbirth.
- 9 in 10 women took iron supplements during their most recent pregnancy.
- 83% of mothers with more than secondary level of education and 49% of those with no education had four or more ANC visits for their last live birth
- 74% of women in urban areas and 62% of those in rural areas had four or more ANC visits for their last live birth
- At the county level, the proportion of women who had four or more ANC visits for their last live birth is lowest in Garissa (31%) and highest in Nyeri (82%)- 

### DELIVERY IN A HEALTH FACILITY

- Delivery in a health facility should be recommended due to the availability of skilled personnel.
- Having access to appropriate medical care and hygienic settings during birth helps lower the risk of problems and infections that could cause the mother's and the baby's death or serious illness.
- According to KDHS 2022; 89% of live births and stillbirths were assisted by a skilled healthcare provider and 82%of live births and stillbirths occurred in a health facility.
- WHO has provided certain recommendations involving labor and delivery care for both the mother and newborn and they include: 
- Making Diagnosis of labor
- Routine monitoring of pregnancy, Maternal and fetal well being.
- Provision of supportive care and pain management.
- Prompt diagnosis and management of pregnancy related complication.
- Delivery and essential newborn care.
- Early initiation of breastfeeding.
- Newborn resuscitation
- Provision of postnatal care.
- WHO recommendations on antenatal care for a positive pregnancy experience. (n.d.). Retrieved March 7, 2023, from https://www.who.int/publications-detail-redirect/9789241549912 
- esThe proportion of live births supported by a skilled provider has risen significantly over the past two decades.

Limitations to delivery in a health facility are as follows:
- Family factors:  Ultimate decision maker(leader of the household), misconceptions regarding deliveries within health facilities.
- Accessibility: Distance to a health facility and means of transportation serve as barriers to deliveries.
- Health facility factors: Lack of essential drugs and supplies as well as delays in offering services play a significant role.
- Sociocultural factors: Knowledge, attitudes and practices of certain communities hinder timely delivery services.


### Danger signs in the mother

- heavy bleeding - in cases of antepartum hemorrhage.
- convulsions/ fits - in case of eclampsia
- severe headache.
- fever - could indicate chorioamnionitis.
- severe abdominal pain
- fast or difficult breathing
- foul smelling vaginal discharge. (MCH BOOKLET)

### Danger signs in the newborn

- poor feeding
- lethargy 
- convulsion
- hyperthermia or hypothermia
- fast breathing
- chest wall indrawing
- jaundice

#### Major causes of the Neonatal morbidity and mortality 

Most neonatal deaths (75%) occur during the first week of life, and in 2019, about 1 million newborns died within the first 24 hours.

Neonatal deaths decreased from 5 million in 1990 to 2.4 million in 2020. 

Chances of survival from birth varies depending on where the child is born.

Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest neonatal mortality rate in 2020 at 27( 25-32) deaths per 1000 live births.

SDG 3 calls for all nations to strive for a neonatal mortality rate of 12 or less per 1000 live births by 2030 in order to put an end to the avoidable deaths of newborns.
