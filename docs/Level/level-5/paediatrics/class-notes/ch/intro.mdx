# Definition & Components of Child Health 

The WHO defines health as a state of physical, mental, intellectual and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.
Child health is ensuring child survival at population level and enabling them to reach their fullest developmental potential.



Promotion of Child Health
Health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve their health.1
It involves empowering caregivers to be active participants in their child’s health and allowing them to participate in a solution.
Government authorities can be involved in child health promotion by:
Providing facilities to control the risk of illnesses 
Formulating laws and policies to control diseases.

Examples of Health Promotion
Nutrition
Undernutrition
Promotion of breastfeeding
Agriculture and food security
Food fortification
Nutrition education 
Overnutrition
Nutrition education 
Promoting healthy foods and drinks e.g. by pricing them lower than less healthy options
Restrictions on advertising of junk food
Hygiene
Hygiene education
Hand washing with soap and water
In schools - school health clubs, inspection of student hygiene
Hygienic food preparation
Talks on menstrual health and hygiene for girls and provision of sanitary products
Being good role models for children - lead by example

Sanitation
Increasing accessibility to basic and improved sanitation facilities
Education on and promotion of proper toilet use and maintenance
Increasing availability and accessibility to safe water for drinking
Public-private partnerships to increase availability of affordable sanitation products and services
Lifestyle
Improving school physical education and physical activity opportunities
Preventing alcohol and tobacco use among the young 
Promoting better sleep by encouraging good sleep hygiene

TYPES OF PREVENTION
1.Primordial- Earliest method of disease prevention.
These are measures with a specific focus on social and environmental factors that promote onset of disease.
Target population- General population.
Objectives- reduces risk as much as possible
Interventions- Promoting physical activity by making sidewalks, spaces for activities for children. This will in turn reduce risk of developing non communicable diseases.

TYPES OF PREVENTION

2.Primary- It involves actions made to stop the spread of disease by reducing its risk factors and causes and focusing on the susceptible population.
Target population-Children who are healthy and have no disease.
Objectives- Prevent occurrence of Disease.
Interventions- Immunization, health education (to recognize signs in a high risk individual to prevent progression to subclinical disease).


TYPES OF PREVENTION

3.Secondary-measures aimed at detecting disease early in asymptomatic patients or when the condition's symptoms are still mild to encourage early intervention.
Target population- Children who are already sick but have early forms of disease.
Objective- Preventing progression to more severe forms of disease.
Interventions- Screening tests(blood tests,TB screening), timely and prompt initiation of treatment at home.

TYPES OF PREVENTION

4.Tertiary- Actions that are taken to optimize care to improve well being of patients with existing disease and prevent complications
Target population- Children with severe disease and complication.
Objectives- To prevent death, further complication and to regain any lost function.
Interventions- Chemotherapy, rehabilitative services, constant screening for complications

LEVELS OF HEALTH SERVICE PROVISION

DISEASE PREVENTION BY HEALTH SERVICE LEVEL

Level 1, 2 & 3
They provide primary level of care.
Involved in primary and secondary prevention measures by:
Health education and health promotion (primary)
Screening services (secondary)
Level 4 and 5
They provide secondary level of care. Involved in tertiary prevention activities. 
Include activities such as in patient admission to prevent progression of Disease.

Level 6 
They provide tertiary level of care and prevention aimed at reducing the severity of a disease once established in an individual.
Also provide rehabilitation to restore function in individuals who’ve developed disability due to disease.
DISEASE PREVENTION BY HEALTH SERVICE LEVEL


CONTROL OF CHILDHOOD DISEASES
Disease control is the reduction in the incidence, prevalence, morbidity or mortality of an infectious disease to a level that is acceptable for a given area.
Effective control of childhood diseases requires a multi-pronged approach that includes preventative measures, early detection, diagnosis and treatment:
Immunization- Vaccines are one of the most effective ways to prevent childhood diseases such as measles, polio, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, etc.
Access to health care- essential in timely detection and treatment of childhood illnesses and preventing complications thus lowering mortality. This includes access to primary care providers who can provide the necessary treatment and management of childhood diseases.


CONTROL OF CHILDHOOD DISEASES
3. Proper nutrition and hygiene- Breastfeeding, sufficient complementary feeding, and vitamin A supplements all help to strengthen a child's immune system. Handwashing frequently promotes hygiene and disease prevention.
4. Clean water and sanitation- Access to clean water and sanitation facilities can help prevent the spread of infectious diseases such as diarrhea and cholera. Efforts should be made to improve water and sanitation infrastructure in communities.
5. Health education- Health education programs can help parents and caregivers understand how to prevent and control childhood diseases. Information should be provided on proper hygiene practices, healthy nutrition, and the importance of immunization.

CONTROL OF CHILDHOOD DISEASES

6. Adequate environmental control- swampy areas are home to mosquitoes that transmit diseases like malaria. Cutting tall grass and draining swamps will aid in malaria prevention. 
7. Government intervention - the government can provide funding to support prevention programs in remote areas, such as offering ITNs, assisting with disease diagnosis, and educating the local population on disease prevention.

DISEASE ELIMINATION AND ERADICATION
Disease elimination
It is the incidence reduction of a disease to zero within a defined geographical area.
It is the prevention of transmission of a disease in a specific region. It is achieved by interrupting the complete transmission of a disease however the disease agent is still present.
However, the elimination of the disease is not permanent, there has to be continued control.




DISEASE ELIMINATION AND ERADICATION

Kenya is the 41st country in the WHO African Region to be certified free of Guinea Worm Disease (GWD)
With this certification, 6 countries remain to be declared free of GWD in the WHO African Region : Angola, DRC, Mali, South sudan, Chad and Ethiopia

Disease eradication 
It is the incidence reduction of a disease to zero globally.
This is the complete interruption of transmission of a disease and this includes the extermination of the disease agent.
Disease eradication is achieved through medications and preventative actions. Methods such as vaccines are used to reduce the disease to zero. 
Once eradication has been achieved, there is no further need for any preventive measures or any treatment required for the disease.
Although many diseases have been eliminated, only one disease that is recognized by WHO to be eradicated is smallpox which was declared as being eradicated in 1979.

While not many diseases have been eradicated, many are being considered for eradication. These include:
Measles, Mumps, Rubella
Polio
Guinea worm disease
Lymphatic filariasis
Cysticercosis 
The major methods of infection control that aid in the elimination and eradication of diseases include:
Hand hygiene
Use of PPE
Resp hygiene/cough etiquette
Sharps safety


Malaria is a parasitic disease transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito. The prevention of malaria can be divided into three categories: primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. Each category involves different strategies to prevent the transmission and spread of the disease.

1: Primary prevention: Primary prevention aims to prevent the initial transmission of the malaria parasite. It includes measures that target the mosquito vector, such as:
Insecticide-treated bed nets: These are long-lasting bed nets that are treated with insecticides. They are effective in preventing mosquito bites and reducing the transmission of malaria.
LEVELS OF PREVENTION OF MALARIA 

Indoor residual spraying: This involves spraying insecticides on the walls and ceilings of homes to kill mosquitoes.
Environmental management: This includes measures to eliminate mosquito breeding sites, such as removing stagnant water and cleaning up garbage and other debris
Chemoprophylaxis: This involves the use of antimalarial drugs to prevent malaria in individuals who are at high risk of infection, such as travelers to endemic areas.

2: Secondary prevention: Secondary prevention aims to detect and treat malaria early to prevent severe illness and death. It includes measures such as:
Early diagnosis and treatment: This involves prompt diagnosis and treatment of uncomplicated malaria cases with oral artemether-lumefantrine to prevent complications.


3: Tertiary prevention: Tertiary prevention aims to prevent the recurrence of malaria in individuals who have already had the disease and prevent complications. It includes measures such as:
Treatment of complicated malaria: This involves the administration of antimalarial drugs (IV artesunate or quinine) to individuals at regular intervals to prevent the recurrence of malaria.
