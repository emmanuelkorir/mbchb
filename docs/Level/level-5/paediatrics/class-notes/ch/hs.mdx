# Health systems for children

A health system consists of all organizations, people and actions whose primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain health. This includes efforts to influence determinants of health as well as more direct activities that improve health.
Child Health care: is defined as the medical services that are provided by the medical health professionals to the children having disease or infection. These services are funded by different health organizations. These medical professionals are specialized and experienced in treating pediatric patients.

## Factors Enhancing Delivery of Services within the Health Infrastructure 

Quality health care is the degree to which health services for individuals increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes.

The characteristics of quality health are:

### Components of the Health system 

- Health system consists of all the organisations, institutions, resources and people whose primary purpose is to improve health
- There are 6 building blocks in healthcare including **service delivery, health workforce, health information system, access to essential medicines, financing and leadership/governance**
- These building blocks work synergistically in different ways to strengthen the healthcare system by enhancing the accessibility, coverage, quality and safety of healthcare for children.


#### Service delivery/healthcare infrastructure 

- Service delivery refers to the way in which inputs are combined to enhance delivery of a series of interventions or health actions to improve children’s health.
- It constitutes the availability and distribution of facilities from primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare levels.
- The basic equipment, diagnostic tools, outpatient facilities and inpatient facilities such as ward space and number of beds are key in determining efficiency and effectiveness in service delivery.
- A good service delivery for children should ensure that the services offered are accessible, comprehensive, person-centered, good quality, well coordinated and safe for all children. 

#### Health workforce 

Health workforce refers to all individuals with a primary aim of improving the health of children.

This includes individuals working for public or private sector and persons working for pay or voluntary basis.

The health workforce extends beyond the people working in healthcare to include their knowledge, skill mix, motivations and distribution along the different levels of the health system.

Kenya healthcare workforce density is at 13.8 per 10,000 population way below the WHO recommendation of 44.5 per 10,000 populations.

#### Health information system 

This refers to the system involved with gathering, compiling and analysis of important health information in children.

An automated HIS is preferred over manual systems to enhance accuracy, reduce cost, and enhance the speed of collection, processing and storage of information.

Kenya uses an automated system (Districts Health Information System 2) DHIS2 for the collection and reporting of health information across different counties.

The DHIS2 is an open source software for collection, validation, analysis and presentation of aggregate and patient-based statistical data, tailored to integrate health information management activities.  

#### Access to essential medicines 

A well functioning health system ensures equitable access to essential medical products, vaccines, and a cost effective technology of assured quality and safety.

Policies and guidelines are required to enhance the procurement, distribution, supply and storage of these products.

There should be a rational utilization of the medicines, commodities and equipment to reduce side effects, enhance adherence and reduce resistance. 

#### Financing 

- Refers to ways in which the health system mobilizes, accumulates and allocates money to cover the health needs of children, general population, individually and collectively.
- The aim of health financing is to enhance availability of funding and to set right financial incentives to providers.
- The incentives to providers ensures that all children have access to effective public health and personal health care and their family and shielded from economic constraints.
- Health systems should protect children and their families from financial hardships by raising sufficient funds for healthcare and reducing prevalence of out-of-pocket payments. 
- Linda Mama was enacted in 2013 with further developments in 2017 to include incentivized maternal services in both public hospitals and approved private facilities 


#### Leadership and governance 

- This in health system for children revolves around enhancing strategic policy framework formulations and effective oversight and design of interventions and health actions to improve children’s health.
- It also involves coordination, regulation, attention to systemic designs and accountable handling of finance, human resources and infrastructure designated for mothers’ and children’s health.
- Most health system for children in most middle and low income countries experience reduced accountability and high corruption

1. Child Health

Child health programs are aimed at ensuring the child’s survival at population level and enabling them to reach their fullest developmental potential. In Kenya, they are:
- Newborn Health
- Integrated Management of Newborn and Childhood Illnesses(IMNCI)
- Integrated Community Case Management(ICCM)
- School Health
- Adolescent Health

### Child Health Programs 

- Newborn Health. Newborn health programs are aimed at improving the survival of newborns beyond the neonatal period. It involves practices that are appropriate and necessary in the care of newborns such as Kangaroo Mother Care(KMC) for premature infants, newborn resuscitation to manage birth asphyxia and promoting successful breastfeeding.
- Integrated Management of Newborn and Childhood Illnesses (IMNCI). This is a set of guidelines that offer simple and effective methods to comprehensively prevent and manage leading causes of serious illnesses and mortality in children under 5. It includes accurate identification of illnesses by their signs and symptoms,appropriate treatment,counselling of caregivers and time sensitive referral or admission of cases.
- Integrated Community Care Management (ICCM). This is a strategy to extend case management of childhood illness beyond health facilities so that more children have access to lifesaving treatments.It most commonly includes conditions with a high mortality rate such as malaria and malnutrition. It involves the identification and training of community health workers in the diagnosis and treatment of key childhood illnesses, and also in identifying children in need of immediate referral.
- School Health. This program was created with the goal of promoting the welfare of school-going children through policies that aim at proper nutrition of children,reducing the incidences of water,sanitation and hygiene related diseases and enhancing prevention and control of communicable and non communicable diseases in schools.
- Adolescent Health. This involves promotion of health in teenagers and young adults by educating them with age appropriate sexual reproductive health information.This is done to reduce the cases of transmission of HIV/AIDS and other STI’s in this age group and also teenage pregnancies. Other topics covered include drug abuse and mental health issues 
- Care for the Disabled/Child rights. This program involves the identification of disabilities,interventions, adequate counselling and training of service providers to the children with disabilities This is done to promote and enhance education and health rights for learners with special needs and disabilities. Child rights education is done inform the learners, parents and the community on the rights of the child and how to safeguard them from child rights abuse.

The  government offers intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) for malaria for pregnant women in malaria endemic regions.

They are also offered with and encouraged to use treated mosquito nets.

5. HIV/AIDS

National PMTCT Program: In order to reduce transmission of HIV from infected pregnant and lactating mothers to their children, the ministry of health, through NASCOP, has taken several actions to strengthen and expand the Prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) interventions.

Currently, over 80 % of pregnant women receive PMTCT services in over 5000 PMTCT sites.

Pregnant mothers who are HIV positive and who have not been on HAART therapy are given Zidovudine and Nevirapine during the intrapartum period and their infants also receive nevirapine postnatally.

6.TB

The Ministry of Health launched the National  Tuberculosis, Leprosy and Lung Disease Program (NTLD-Program) in 2019 which aims at reducing the burden of lung disease in Kenya and rendering Kenya free of Tuberculosis and Leprosy.

At birth, all babies receive the BCG vaccine to protect them from Tuberculosis.
