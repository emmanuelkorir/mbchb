# Public Health Programs for Child Health (Malaria)

WHO defines malaria as an acute febrile illness that is caused by Plasmodium parasites that is spread to people through bites from an infected female Anopheles mosquito.

The Plasmodium parasites that cause disease in humans are:
- P. falciparum
- P. malariae
- P. ovale
- P. vivax

The major vectors that transmit malaria in Kenya include A. gambiae and A. fenestus.

Malaria can be classified into 2 categories:
- Severe malaria
- Uncomplicated malaria

### Definitions
- Anthropophilic: Describes mosquitoes that prefer to take blood meals from humans.
- Endophagic: An endophagic mosquito is a mosquito that feeds indoors.
- Endophilic: An endophilic mosquito is a mosquito that tends to inhabit/rest indoors. Endophilism facilitates the blocking of malaria transmission through application of residual insecticides to walls.
- Exophagic: An exophagic mosquito is a mosquito that feeds outdoors.
- Exophilic: An exophilic mosquito tends to inhabit/rest outdoors. Residual insecticides in buildings are less effective at controlling exophilic mosquitoes
- Radical cure/radical treatment: complete elimination of malaria parasites from the body; the term applies specifically to elimination of dormant liver stage parasites (hypnozoites) found in Plasmodium vivax and P. ovale.
- Recrudescence: A repeated attack of malaria due to the survival of malaria parasites in red blood cells.
- Relapse: Recurrence of disease after it has been apparently cured. In malaria, true relapses are caused by reactivation of dormant liver stage parasites (hypnozoites) found in Plasmodium vivax and P. ovale.
- Resistance: The ability of an organism to develop ways to be impervious to specific threats to their existence. The malaria parasite has developed strains that are resistant to drugs such as chloroquine. The Anopheles mosquito has developed strains that are resistant to DDT and other insecticides.

### Uncomplicated Malaria

Uncomplicated malaria occurs when one is infected with malaria parasites and exhibits the signs and symptoms but there is no evidence of end organ dysfunction.

The signs and symptoms include:
- Fever
- Chills
- Sweats
- Nausea and Vomiting
- Muscle aches
- Headaches

### Severe malaria

Severe malaria is defined as symptomatic malaria with evidence of vital end organ dysfunction in the presence of plasmodium parasites in peripheral blood.

According to WHO, the clinical features of severe malaria include:
- Impaired consciousness
- Prostration i.e generalized weakness so that patient is unable to sit, stand or walk without assistance
- Multiple convulsions: more than 2 episodes within 24 hours
- Acidotic breathing
- Acute pulmonary oedema and acute respiratory distress syndrome
- Circulatory collapse or shock, systolic BP <80 mmHg in adults and < 50 mmHg in children
- AKI
- Clinical jaundice with evidence of any other end organ dysfunction
- Abnormal bleeding

### Primary level of care of malaria

Primary care is the first contact between an individual, family and the community with the health system i.e with a primary care provider for non emergency situations.

The aim is to bring health care services closer to where people live and work.

The community actively collaborates with the health care system in order to achieve a personâ€™s needs from health promotion to disease prevention, early diagnosis and treatment, rehabilitation, palliative care and more.

The key role players in primary level of care would be those in the community from the individual, family members and community health workers.

### Primary level of care of malaria

#### Primary prevention

We can achieve this by targeting the determinants of disease; at the level of the host, vector and environment.
1. At host level:

Offering chemoprophylaxis to populations that are non immune e.g tourists, sickle cell patients and pregnant women
- Atovaquone/Proguanil 1 day before travel, throughout travel and 1 week after travel
- Proguanil for those with sickle cell disease
- IPTp- sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
- Children that reside in malaria endemic regions can be vaccinated using RTS,S/AS01

2. At vector level:
- Indoor residual spraying
- Use of long lasting insecticidal nets
- Use of repellant
- Larviciding
- Screening of house inlets with wire mesh to reduce the entry of mosquitoes
- At environmental level:
- Adequate drainage of breeding sites
- Improve sanitation and waste disposal

#### Secondary prevention

- Focuses on early diagnosis and treatment of malaria to prevent progression to severe forms.
- Parasitological tests(RDTs,microscopy) used to test all people suspected of having malaria.
- Children and adults excluding pregnant women in the first trimester treated with Artemether-lumefantrine. 2nd line-dihydroartemisinin together with piperaquine
- Treatment for at least 3 days.
- Pregnant women in the first trimester-quinine plus clindamycin 
- Paracetamol for fever and encourage adequate fluids and food intake
- Tertiary prevention
- Pre-referral treatment for severe malaria;single dose IM artesunate and refer to an appropriate facility.

#### Burden of disease caused by malaria

According to the World Malaria Report 2022, there was an estimated 247 million cases of malaria globally in 2021 which is an increase from 245 million the previous year.
Malaria case incidence (i.e. cases per 1000 population at risk) reduced from 82 in 2000 to 57 in 2019, before increasing to 59 in 2020. There was no change in case incidence between 2020 and 2021 mainly attributable to disruption of services due to the COVID- 19 pandemic.
Malaria deaths globally, have been reducing steadily between 2000 to 2019, however malaria deaths increased in 2020 by 10% compared to 2019 mainly due to disruption of essential malaria services during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The percentage of malaria deaths among children aged under five in reduced from 87% in 2000 to 76% in 2015. Since then there has been no change.
In Africa, it is estimated that malaria cases increased from 218 million in 2019 to 232 million cases in 2020 to 234 million cases in 2021. This contributes to 95% of all global cases.
Deaths attributable to malaria in the WHO African region also increased from 544,000 in 2019 to 599,000 in 2020.
According to the report, the WHO African region contributes 95% of all global cases, 96% of all global deaths and 78.9% of all the deaths under 5 years of age.

According to the Kenya Malaria Indicator Strategy 2020, Malaria remains a public concern contributing 13%-15% of out-patient consultations.
Approximately 70% of the population is at risk of infection including 13 million in endemic regions and 19 million in the highland epidemic prone areas and the seasonal transmission areas. 
There are an estimated 3.5 million new clinical cases and 10,700 deaths in Kenya each year, 
In 2020, malaria cases for the Kenyan population was at 50.9 cases per 100,000 people. The number of cases fell gradually from 241.7 cases per 100,000 in 2001 
In the 2020 KMIS Malaria was presumed in 36% of children under 5 years presenting with a fever. Malaria was tested for using Rapid diagnostic tests(RDT) and microscopy.

#### Strategies for malaria control and prevention

1. Insecticide Treated Nets (ITN)

2006- ITNs distributed to high risk areas and limited to pregnant women and under 5 infants

2011- Distribution widened to everyone in high risk areas

2014- WHO recommended distribution of Long lasting Insecticide Nets (LLIN) to high risk areas 

ITNs repel, disable and kill vector mosquitoes

2 classes of insecticides used: Pyrroles and Pyrethroids

WHO recommends use of combination (Pyrethroid- Piperonyl Butoxide (PBO))

Effectiveness of ITNs is highest in areas the mosquito bites at night

Source: UNICEF- Long-lasting insecticidal nets market and supply update


2. Indoor Residual Spraying

Walls and other surfaces are coated with insecticides which kills mosquitoes and other insects that come into contact with the surfaces

For 2-6 months

Only effective for endophilic mosquitoes

IRS is appropriate where proportion of room sprayed is >80%, and vectors are susceptible to insecticide used 

3. Preventive Chemotherapies

Refers to use of medicines either alone or in combination to prevent malaria

Full course of treatment is given to vulnerable population (infants, children under 5 and pregnant women)

Preventive chemotherapy can be perennial, seasonal, intermittent (in pregnant women and school going children), post discharge and mass drug administration

Sulfadoxine- Pyrimethamine is used in pregnancy 

4. Community Case Management (CCM)

This refers to an equity focused strategy which complements and extends reach of health services by providing timely and effective management of malaria to population with limited facility-based healthcare

WHO recommends all suspected cases be confirmed using microscopy and rapid  diagnostic test

Differentiation between malarial and non-malarial fevers

Best available treatment is artemisinin based combination therapy (ACT)

Primary objective is rapid elimination of plasmodium parasites to prevent an uncomplicated case from progressing to severe disease and death

2. Parasitological diagnosis

Light microscopy: Gold standard

Thick blood smear prefered for detection and quantification

Diagnosis

Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT)

Identifies parasite-specific antigens in a finger prick blood sample

Monoclonal antibodies directed to species specific antigens (HRP2 for P. falciparum)

### Treatment

1. Uncomplicated Malaria

WHO 2021- Artemisinin based combination therapy

Artemether + Lumefantrine (20 mg & 120mg respectively, over 3 days)

Artesunate + Amodiaquine

Artesunate + mefloquine

Dihydroartemisinin + Piperaquine

Artesunate + Sulfadoxine - Pyrimethamine

2. Complicated Malaria

Parenteral Artesunate (IV preferred)

Parenteral quinine

Supportive treatment

### Other strategies for prevention and control

1. Vaccine

From 2021, WHO recommended use of RTS, S/AS01 malaria vaccine among children in regions with moderate to high malaria transmission

4 doses in children from 5 months old: 6, 7, 9 and 24 months  (WHO, 2021)

2. Surveillance

Refers to continuous and systematic collection of data for analysis and interpretation of malaria data

Data obtained is used in implementation, planning and evaluation of public health practice

Helps MOH determine areas and population groups that are most affected

Monitor changes in patterns of disease

Design effective health interventions and evaluate impact of their malaria control programmes
