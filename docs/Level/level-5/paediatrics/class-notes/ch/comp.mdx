# Complementary feeding

COMPLEMENTARY FEEDING
Process of introducing other foods and liquids alongside breastfeeding, when  breast milk is no longer sufficient to meet the nutritional requirements of the infant, from 6-24 months of age.
Complementary feeding is critical to prevent micronutrient  deficiencies, stunting, obesity and mortality.
According to WHO, complementary feeding should be:
Timely: introduced when nutrient needs exceed what can be provided through exclusive breastfeeding (6 months)
Adequate: sufficient to meet nutritional need of the growing child
Safe: hygienically stored and  prepared
Properly fed: Given consistently with hunger signs, with frequency and feeding suitable for age



WHO Guiding principles to appropriate complementary feeding for a breastfed child
Exclusive breast feeding from birth to 6 months and introduce complementary feeding at 6 months while breastfeeding continues.
Continue breastfeeding frequently and on demand up to 2 years and beyond.
Practice responsive feeding by applying psychosocial aspects.
Practicing good hygiene and proper food handling.
Start at 6 months with food in small amounts and increasing it as child grows older while maintaining frequent breastfeeding.

WHO Guiding principles to appropriate complementary feeding for a breastfed child
Gradually increase in variety and consistency of foods as baby grows , while adapting to the baby’s requirement and abilities.
Increasing the number of times of complementary feeding as baby grows older.
Feeding a variety of nutrient-rich foods ensuring all nutrient needs are met.
 Using fortified complementary foods or vitamin-mineral supplements for the infant, as needed.
 Increasing fluid intake during illness, including breastfeeding and encouraging soft and favorite food intake. Encourage increased food intake after an illness.


FEEDING AN INFANT AGED 6-8 MONTHS
Frequency-Feed your baby complementary foods 3 time a day

Amount-start with 2/3 tablespoon and increase gradually

Thickness-Give mashed/pureed family foods
The food should be thick enough so that it does not slide off the spoon.

Variety-Try to feed a variety of foods at each meal.
- pureed fruits, vegetables, cereal, mashed or soft-cooked meat

FEEDING OF INFANT 9-11 MONTHS
Frequency- 4/5 times a day

Amount- up to half a cup (250ml)

Thickness - Give finely chopped family foods, sliced foods

Variety- Should include all as previously mentioned.
   Energy rich oil is encouraged in each meal


Feeding of infant 9-11 months

FEEDING A CHILD AGED 12-24 MONTHS
Frequency-3/4 meals and 1/2 snacks

Amount- ¾ to 1 Full cup

Thickness – Give family foods cut into small pieces

Variety-  As mentioned previously 

Feeding a child aged 12-24 months

Adequacy and amount of complementary feeds

Complementary foods are needed to fill the energy gap. 
The quantity of food needed increases as the child gets older.

Dietary diversity
Children should receive foods from 4 or more food groups to ensure their nutritional needs are met
food groups:
grains, roots, tubers
legumes and nuts
dairy and dairy products
flesh foods
eggs
vitamin-A rich fruits and vegetables
other fruits and vegetables

Advice to the Caregiver (1)
Responsive feeding
This is feeding characterised by the child communicating feelings of hunger or satiety through cues, which is then followed by an appropriate and immediate response from the caregiver to meet the child’s needs.
For example, 
	feed infants directly and assist older children. infants should be fed directly and older chilen should be assisted
	the child should be fed slowly and patiently, 
	encourage the child to eat but do not force them,
	 talk to the child and maintain eye contact



Advice to the Caregiver (2)
Food safety
maintain cleanliness: hand hygiene, use of clean utensils, clean surfaces,
cook food thoroughly
keeping food at safe temperatures
use of safe water
avoid use of feeding bottles

Avoid sugary food and foods that have low nutrient value.

Offer food that has fat content.
