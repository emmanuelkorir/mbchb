# Complementary Feeding

Process of introducing other foods and liquids alongside breastfeeding, when  breast milk is no longer sufficient to meet the nutritional requirements of the infant, from 6-24 months of age.

Complementary feeding is critical to prevent micronutrient  deficiencies, stunting, obesity and mortality.

According to WHO, complementary feeding should be:
- Timely: introduced when nutrient needs exceed what can be provided through exclusive breastfeeding (6 months)
- Adequate: sufficient to meet nutritional need of the growing child
- Safe: hygienically stored and  prepared
- Properly fed: Given consistently with hunger signs, with frequency and feeding suitable for age

### WHO Guiding principles to appropriate complementary feeding for a breastfed child

- Exclusive breast feeding from birth to 6 months and introduce complementary feeding at 6 months while breastfeeding continues.
- Continue breastfeeding frequently and on demand up to 2 years and beyond.
- Practice responsive feeding by applying psychosocial aspects.
- Practicing good hygiene and proper food handling.
- Start at 6 months with food in small amounts and increasing it as child grows older while maintaining frequent breastfeeding.
- Gradually increase in variety and consistency of foods as baby grows , while adapting to the baby’s requirement and abilities.
- Increasing the number of times of complementary feeding as baby grows older.
- Feeding a variety of nutrient-rich foods ensuring all nutrient needs are met.
- Using fortified complementary foods or vitamin-mineral supplements for the infant, as needed.
- Increasing fluid intake during illness, including breastfeeding and encouraging soft and favorite food intake. Encourage increased food intake after an illness.

- Amount - ¾ to 1 Full cup(250ml)

- Thickness - Give family foods cut into small pieces

Adequacy and amount of complementary feeds

Complementary foods are needed to fill the energy gap. 

The quantity of food needed increases as the child gets older.

### Advice to the Caregiver 

#### Responsive feeding

This is feeding characterised by the child communicating feelings of hunger or satiety through cues, which is then followed by an appropriate and immediate response from the caregiver to meet the child’s needs.

For example, 
- feed infants directly and assist older children. Infants should be fed directly and older children should be assisted
- the child should be fed slowly and patiently, 
- encourage the child to eat but do not force them,
- talk to the child and maintain eye contact

#### Food safety

Maintain cleanliness: hand hygiene, use of clean utensils, clean surfaces

Cook food thoroughly, keeping food at safe temperatures

Use of safe water

Avoid use of feeding bottles

Avoid sugary food and foods that have low nutrient value.

Offer food that has fat content.

### Hunger and satiety cues for children on complementary feeds

#### Hunger Cues
- Reaches for or points to food.
- Opens his or her mouth when offered a spoon or food.
- Gets excited when he or she sees food.
- Uses hand motions or makes sounds to let you know he or she is still hungry.

#### Satiety Cues
- Pushes food away.
- Closes his or her mouth when food is offered.
- Turns his or her head away from food.
- Uses hand motions or makes sounds to let you know he or she is full.
