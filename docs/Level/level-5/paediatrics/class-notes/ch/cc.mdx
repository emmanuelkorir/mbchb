# Cold Chain System Management

Cold chain is a system of keeping vaccines at temperature-controlled environments (2-8°C) to store, manage and transport them (Manufacturing point - vaccination of beneficiary)

- Need to store vaccines in a limited range of temperature
- Extremes of temperature (too high or too low) cause vaccines to lose potency
- Potency once lost cannot be regained or restored


### Components of a Cold Chain System

- Transport and storage equipment
- Trained personnel
- efficient management procedures




### Sources of Vaccines for Kenya

Bilateral agreements between countries WHO through UNICEF :
- Traditional vaccines:- Measles, BCG, Tetanus Toxoid and Polio
- GAVI (Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization):
- PCV, Rotavirus, Pentavalent and Yellow Fever
- COVAX: Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access 

Through KEMSA:

- Non-EPI vaccines -public procurement procedures (Hepatitis B, Typhoid vaccine and biological sera such as anti-snake venom and anti-rabies antibodies)

- GlaxoSmithKline (malaria), Sanofi Pasteur(IPV), Serum Institute of India( pentavalent, 2021) Pfizer(covid 19)


### Vaccine Transport

When UNICEF sends vaccines, they always travel directly by plane from the manufacturer as refrigerated cargo to the country where they will be used. Once they land, they are stored in cold rooms before being distributed to regional and sub-regional cold storage facilities by refrigerated vehicles. From storage facilities down to the village level, health workers carry vaccines in cold boxes and vaccine carriers, traveling by car, motorcycle, bicycle, donkey, camel or on foot to immunize every child, even in the most remote of villages.

MoH - Obtains customs clearance

Logistics manager - manage receipt, clearance and transport • Confirms all processes and paperwork for clearance at least 7 days before first shipment 

Cold chain manager - Validates contents of each shipper • Removes vaccine packs and loads in ULT freezers within 3 minutes to prevent exposure to ambient temperature • Stores dry ice in ULT freezer for reuse during in-country distribution

Procurement and shipment

Custom clearance and inspection

Packing and loading vaccines in ULT (Ultra low temperature) freezers

Transfer to National Vaccine Store in Kitengela: Refrigerated vehicles and cold boxes are used (Temp 2- 8 º C)

### Storage of Vaccines

Equipment for storage and monitoring of temperatures 

Cold rooms(-2 to +5) and freezer rooms(-40 to -18)

Freezers(-80 to -15) and Ice-lined refrigerators(+2 to +8)

Gas electric refrigerators (+2 to +8)

Solar refrigerators (+2 to +8)

Vaccine transportation carriers with Ice packs(<+10)

Thermometers- Standard fluid-filled, Min-max.

Vaccine Storage temperatures

Temperature monitoring devices

Vaccine vial monitors (VVMs) – Which shows if the vaccines have been exposed to heat or freeze damage

Stop!WatchTM Indicator: used to monitor temperatures in a refrigerator over time.

DT and TT shipping indicator: used to monitor DT and TT vaccines which are destroyed at temperatures above 480C during shipment.

Cold chain monitor card (CCM) - These are designed to monitor the vaccine temperature from the point of manufacture to the point of administration and are kept together with the vaccine batch. Have four windows containing indicators, and their color change indicate temperature change

Freeze WatchTM indicator: used for freeze-sensitive vaccines. a vial in the indicator bursts and releases red liquid when the vaccine is exposed to temperatures below 0°c  for more than 1 hour.

### Vaccine Vial Monitoring

The “shake test” was designed to detect freeze damage in aluminum-based, adsorbed, freeze sensitive vaccines such as DTP, DT, TT, typhoid, and hepatitis B. These vaccines must never be frozen as this reduces their immunogenicity. When these vaccines freeze, the alum content gets loose, tends to agglomerate, and sediments faster than vaccines that have not suffered freeze damage. 

### Storage of Vaccines

#### National Level

At the national level cold rooms and freezer rooms store vaccines in a frozen state at temperatures of less than -15°C  

These vaccines can be stored for more than 6 months at the National Vaccine Stores in Kitengela   

Vaccines to be delivered to the regional level need to be thawed not heated.

#### Regional level

The Regional Vaccine Stores in Kenya also store vaccines at a temperature range of +2°C to +8°C.  

The vaccines are stored in smaller refrigerators and freezers that are well maintained and monitored for temperature control.   

The duration of storage of vaccines at the Regional Vaccine Stores is usually shorter than at the National Vaccine Stores.   

The vaccines are usually distributed to the sub-county vaccine depots within a few days of arrival at the Regional Vaccine Stores

#### Sub county level

Vaccines, diluents and equipment are stored at the subcounty vaccine depots from where they are distributed to the vaccination centers.  

They are stored at temperatures of +2°C to +8°C in ice lined refrigerators.

Duration of storage depends on demand of vaccines but can be stored for up to 3 months within the depots.

#### Health facilities

Temperatures of +2°C to +8°C  

Equipment used in the storage and monitoring include Ice-Lined Refrigerators( VestFrost), Thermometers (FT2), Temperature monitoring sheets, VVM   

Duration:- 1 month  

Multidose vaccines can be returned to storage for 28 days after opening. BCG, Rota virus vaccine and Measles vaccine can only be used up to 6hrs then discarded. 

Diluents stored at similar temperatures

#### Use of Vaccines at Vaccination Sites

Injectable vaccines must be administered by competent health care personnel.   

Oral vaccines can be administered by other staff under medical supervision.

Ensuring availability of appropriate vaccine, equipment and temperature

Vaccines should only be opened/prepared when ready to administer and should be used within 6 hours. Ensure that the VVM indicates that it is suitable for use.

After preparation, the vaccine should not be refrigerated, but can be stored in a cooler box for up to 6 hrs.


### Screen for eligibility

Vaccine education

Check the route and site of administration of the vaccine

Hand hygiene practice

Correct disposal of used needles and vials

Proper record keeping
