# Public Health Programs for Child Health (Tuberculosis)

Primary level care of TB refers to the first level of  care received by individuals with TB  at their first point of contact with the health system.

Primary health care providers are usually the first to meet the patients and have a unique opportunity to decrease the burden of TB through early detection of the disease which can easily infect others around them.

This  care involves health promotion, disease prevention, patient education, health maintenance and early diagnosis and initiation of treatment of TB.

Specific interventions include:
- Screening of child contacts of adults or adolescents with TB and are smear positive.Depending on presence of symptoms and if the child is high risk for developing TB, they should investigate for presence of TB and initiate treatment and start prophylaxis for those who are asymptomatic but at high risk for developing TB respectively..
- Educating the community on signs and symptoms of TB and the importance of seeking medical care if symptoms occur.
- Ensure all children receive the BCG vaccine to protect them from developing severe forms of TB.
- Putting emphasis on adherence to TB medication up till completion in order to achieve cure .

Patients from risk groups for TB should be monitored.

Prompt diagnosis of children presenting with suggestive signs and symptoms of TB and fast initiation of treatment for the appropriate duration depending on the type of TB.

Educate the community on diseases such as HIV and practices that would undermine its transmission as it poses high risk for development of TB.

Educate community members on the need to practice proper cough etiquette and appropriate hand hygiene to limit its spread.


### Classification of TB

Classification according to Pathogenesis
- This clinical classification system for TB provides clinicians with the opportunity to track the development of TB in their patients. 

Classification according to Drug Sensitivity
- Drug resistant TB is TB that is resistant to one or more antitubercular agents
- Requires longer treatment, more expensive and associated with increased toxicity

#### Types
- Rifampin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB)

Resistance to rifampin with or without resistance to other antitubercular drugs 

- Monoresistant TB

Resistance to one of the first-line antitubercular drugs (rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol)

- Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)

Resistance to both isoniazid and rifampin

- Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB)
Resistance to any single fluoroquinolone and at least one of the second-line injectable drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin) in addition to MDR-TB

### Magnitude of ill health caused by TB

Tuberculosis remains a global threat to public health and is the leading cause of death by a single infectious agent (Enos et al,.2016)

TB remains to be a public health concern both locally and globally and is associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality (KDHS2022).

Globally WHO estimates that approximately 10.6 million people fell ill with TB in 2021. This translated to 134 cases per 100,000 population.

Most of the TB cases globally were reported in South East Asia(45%) and Africa(23%).

Kenya is one of 30 countries with a high burden of TB disease, which together with other TB endemic countries contribute to nearly 80% of world TB cases as of 2016.

At the time the incidence was 558 cases per 100,000, but the cases have declined over time currently standing at approximately 256 per 100,000 people.(WHO 2022)

### Risk factors for TB

- Young age.
- Alcohol, Smoking and drug use.
- Close contact with a patient with active TB infection. ( both at home and in health facilities)
- Crowded living Conditions
- Low socioeconomic status. ( malnutrition, indoor air pollution, excessive alcohol use)
- Immunosuppressive states ( HIV, immunosuppressive therapy, diabetes, malnutrition)
- Use of TNF-alpha inhibitors 
- Ingestion of unpasteurized milk.
- Migration from a country with high number of cases.

### Distribution of TB

TB exists in all nations and among all age groups. 

A WHO report from 2021 states that a total of 1.5 million people died from TB in 2020. (including 214 000 people with HIV). 

Globally, 10.6 million people contracted TB. Of those, 1.2 million were children. 

After COVID-19, TB is the second most common infectious killer and the 13th leading cause of death globally. 

86% of new TB cases in 2020 were found in the 30 countries with the highest TB burden. 

Eight nations, led by India, are responsible for two thirds of the total, with China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, and South Africa following.


#### Global Distribution of TB

In 2021, eight countries accounted for more than two thirds of global TB cases: India (28%), Indonesia (9.2%), China (7.4%), the Philippines (7.0%), Pakistan (5.8%), Nigeria (4.4%), Bangladesh (3.6%) and Democratic Republic of the Congo (2.9%) (WHO TB annual report 2022)

The severity of national TB epidemics, in terms of the number of incident TB cases per 100 000 population per year, varies widely among countries. In 2021, countries with the highest rates were mostly in the WHO African Region. (WHO TB annual report 2022) 

#### Distribution of TB in Kenya

Kenya is among the 30 high TB burden countries as declared by the world Health Organization (WHO).

The prevalence of TB in Kenya, as of 2019, was 558 cases per 100,000 people.

The highest disease burden was between 25-34 years, more in males and amongst those living in urban areas.

Approximately 140,000 people fell ill with TB in 2020 in Kenya.

In Kenya, 5663 childhood TB cases were notified to the program (National TB, leprosy and lung disease program)

### Control Measures of TB

#### 1. DOTS strategy (1994-2005)

Directly Obtained Treatment, Short-course (DOTS) strategy is the most effective strategy for controlling TB epidemic today.

Has 5 key components:
- Government commitment to sustained TB control activities
- Case detection by sputum smear microscopy among symptomatic patients self reporting to health services.
- Standardized treatment regimen for 6-8 months for at least all confirmed sputum smear positive cases .
- A regular uninterrupted supply of all essential anti-TB drugs.
- A standardized recording and reporting system that allows assessment of treatment results for each patient and of the TB control programme overall.

New challenges to implementation of DOTS strategy include health sector reforms, the worsening HIV epidemic and emergence of drug resistance strain of TB

#### 2. STOP TB STRATEGY ( 2006 -2015)

Components include:
- Pursue high quality DOTS expansion and enhancement
- Address TB/HIV, MDR-TB and other challenges
- Contribute to health system strengthening
- Engage all care providers
- Empower people with TB, and communities
- Enable and promote research.

#### 3. END TB Strategy (2014)

Vision: A world free of TB. Zero deaths, disease and suffering due to TB.

Goal: End the global tuberculosis epidemic.

Indicators: 
- 95% reduction by 2035 in number of TB deaths compared with 2015.
- 90% reduction by 2035 in TB incidence rate compared with 2015.
- Zero TB-affected families facing catastrophic costs due to TB by 2035. 

Principles: 
- Government stewardship and accountability, with monitoring and evaluation.
- Strong coalition with civil society organizations and communities.
- Protection and promotion of human rights, ethics and equity.
- Adaptation of the strategy and targets at country level, with global collaboration.

### TB/HIV Co-infection

HIV is the top and TB is the second leading cause of death in people with infectious diseases worldwide

People living with HIV and are not on ART have a 7-10% higher risk of getting TB annually

The WHO African Region, has the highest burden of HIV-associated TB Overall in 2021, only 46% of TB patients known to be living with HIV were on ART.

Most childhood TB cases in Kenya were detected through passive case finding

TB prevention interventions among HIV infected children, early diagnosis of HIV and early AntiRetroviral Therapy initiation among children on TB treatment should be strengthened.

The use of combination ARV treatment reduced the probability of HIV infected child being diagnosed with incident TB by 85%

### TB/HIV Co-infection

35,000-estimated people who developed TB and were coinfected with HIV

17,675-people were diagnosed with both, HIV infection and TB disease

### PREVENTION OF TB

BCG vaccination to infants. Highly effective in preventing severe forms of TB such as miliary TB and TB meningitis. Older children and adults are also eligible if they have a weakened immune system and live in high-burden countries.

Contact tracing is a process used to stop the spread of many different infections in the community. It involves finding and informing the people that an infected person has been in contact with so they can get counselling, testing and treatment if necessary with focus on TB.

The case detection rate is the number of reported cases per 100,000 persons per year divided by the estimated incidence rate per 100,000 per year. WHOâ€™s goal for tuberculosis (TB) control is to detect 70% of cases with a new, smear-positive TB test.

The cure rate of TB refers to the proportion of patients with TB who are successfully treated and cured of the disease. WHO target cure rate is 85%.

#### Secondary TB Prevention

Target population

TB endemic areas

Those with a high risk of progression or transmission

Strategies

TB screening and determine eligibility for TB preventive strategy based on outcome

Counsel based on outcome

Educate on the importance of adherence to therapy

##### TB Preventive Therapy

Groups who should receive TB preventive therapy:

All children under 5 years

HIV positive patients exposed to TB

Children at high risk such as, those on dialysis, immunomodulatory drugs, those with autoimmune disease, organ or hematological transplant preparation

### Preventive Regimens 	

INH + Rifapentine for 3 months once weekly.

Rifampin 4 months one daily.

INH + Rifampicin for 3 months daily.

6 months of INH daily (adults + children) or 9 months for adults and children.

### Steps of TB Contact Tracing

Identify the index patient

Obtain a complete list of household and close contacts who may have been exposed to the index patient.

Obtain contact information for all identified contacts.

Prioritize Contacts for evaluation based on the level of exposure and the risk of transmission.

Notify and educate contacts about the risk of TB infection and provide instructions on what to do if symptoms develop.

Conduct TB screening tests on all contacts to determine if they have been infected with TB.

Conduct follow-up evaluations on contacts who test negative for TB infection to ensure that they do not develop active TB disease later.

Provide appropriate treatment for contacts who test positive for TB infection.

Monitor treatment compliance for contacts who are prescribed treatment for TB infection to ensure that they complete the entire course of treatment.

Document all contact tracing activities.

### MDR-TB

Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) is caused by an organism that is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin, the two most potent TB drugs. These drugs are used to treat all persons with TB disease.

Factors that contribute to the development of MDR-TB include incomplete or incorrect treatment of TB, inadequate drug supply or quality, poor patient adherence to treatment, and inadequate infection control measures.

Primary resistance - occurs when a person is infected with MTB that is already resistant to a particular drug

Secondary resistance - there is a history of anti TB treatment and acquires resistance to any of the first line drugs

### MDR-TB

Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) is caused by an organism that is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin, the two most potent TB drugs. These drugs are used to treat all persons with TB disease.Factors that contribute to the development of MDR-TB include incomplete or incorrect treatment of TB, inadequate drug supply or quality, poor patient adherence to treatment, and inadequate infection control measures.

Primary resistance 

MDR-TB can lead to severe health problems and even death if not treated properly, making it a serious global public health concern. It requires specialized treatment with a combination of second-line drugs that are often more expensive and can cause more severe side effects than first-line drugs.

#### Prevention and control of MDR-TB

All medications to be taken exactly as prescribed by the health care provider. No dose missed and treatment not ended early.

Health care providers should quickly diagnosing cases ; starting patients on the appropriate drugs following recommend guidelines

Avoid exposure to known MDR TB patients in  crowded areas. Health officers should be on high alert in places like prisons.

Personal respiratory protective devices should be used when working in exposed areas together with following all administrative  and environmental procedures for preventing MDR TB.
