# Key Family Practices


#### Definition

These are behaviors that can be promoted at individual and/ or community level to ensure child survival, reduce morbidity and promote healthy growth and development

The rationale behind these practices is that effective interventions to promote these practices have an impact on child health

They require systematic planning, well coordinated use of a combination of channels of communication, close follow up, monitoring and supervision 

The interventions need to go beyond knowledge acquisition to facilitate changes in behavior.

They are formulated and laid down by WHO and UNICEF in an attempt to improve child survival.

Majority of the practices focus on primary disease prevention.

Active community involvement and participation raises the probability of sustainability and positive outcome.

The ultimate outcome of these practices include promotion of child health and improved socio-economic status.

#### 16 Key family practices

Key Family Care Practices (KFCPs) are commonly practiced behaviors at household and community level that have an impact on child survival, growth and development or on the causes of morbidity (illness/disease) and mortality in children.

They are grouped into 4 categories:

1. Child feeding, growth and development
2. Disease or illness prevention
3. Appropriate home care
4. Care seeking and compliance/ response to illnesses

#### A. Child Feeding, Growth and Development

1. Exclusive Breastfeeding

All babies should be exclusively breastfed until they are 6 months of age. Maternal antibodies contained in breast milk play a role in immunity as breastfed infants less than 2 months are 6 times less likely to die from infectious diseases. Also, early and exclusive breastfeeding prevents half of all diarrheal episodes in infants (Hamer et al.2022).

2. Complementary Foods

From 6 months of age, babies should be fed freshly prepared energy and nutrient-rich complementary foods while continuing breastfeeding up to 2 years of age and beyond. Appropriate complementary food practices contribute to approximately 17% reduction in prevalence of stunting at 24 months and could prevent 6% of under 5 deaths each year (Masuke et al.2021).

3. Micronutrients

Children, adolescents and women should receive adequate amounts of micronutrients such as vitamin A, zinc and iron and should be dewormed. Zinc supplementation reduces diarrhea incidence by 18% and pneumonia by 41%.

4. Promotion of Mental and Social Development

During early childhood (0-8years), this should be done through responsive and stimulating care such as talking, playing, showing affection and providing a stimulating, learning and safe environment. Early stimulation encourages development and strengthening of brain function.

#### B. Disease Prevention

5. Immunization

Children should be taken 5 times before their 1st birthday to complete the full course of immunization against major childhood illnesses such as TB, pneumonia, whooping cough, polio, measles and diarrhea and adolescent girls to receive HPV vaccine against cervical cancer at 10 years. According to WHO, immunization currently prevents over 4 million death every year.

6. Hygiene

Hands should be washed with clean water and soap before handling meals, before feeding children and after using the toilet/latrine and after disposing feces including children’s. Appropriate hand hygiene prevents up to 21% of respiratory and 30% of diarrheal infections in children under five (UNICEF 2021).  

7. Malaria

Pregnant women and children are required to sleep under insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) every night and particularly those living in malaria-endemic areas. This has resulted in a 45% reduction in malaria incidence (Ng’ang’a et al.2021).

8. Appropriate behavior for preventing HIV/AIDS

Support and encourage adolescents to use youth-friendly services and get information about STDs/STIs, HIV/AIDS and contraception. Also, community interventions such as psychosocial support,  education and home based care should be offered to children affected by HIV in their families and communities.

#### C. Appropriate Home care

9. Feeding during illness

Children should continue to be fed and offered more fluids, including breast milk when they are sick. Continued feeding has been shown to preserve nutrient consumption and improve recovery.

10. Home treatment of Infections

Children and pregnant women should be offered appropriate home treatment during sickness and recovery. Oral rehydration therapy for management of acute diarrhea has been shown to reduce mortality by 93% and is considered one of the most effective treatment interventions that can be given both at home and in health facilities.

11. Managing child Injuries

Appropriate actions should be made to prevent and manage child injuries and accidents at home and in the community by teaching the first aid measures to both caregivers and teachers.

12. Child abuse and neglect

Children and women should be protected and any cases of neglect and abuse reported e.g FGM, rape, defilement and child marriage. Ongoing care of children and families can reduce risk of re-occurrence of maltreatment.

13. Men’s active participation

Men should be involved actively in offering care to women during pregnancy, childbirth and after birth, and in accessing family planning. This can lead to improved utilization of maternal health services and reduce maternal depression. 

#### D. Care Seeking and Compliance

14. Seeking care outside home treatment

Caregivers should recognize when sick children need treatment outside the home and seek care from appropriate healthcare providers. Poor care seeking has been implicated in 6-70% of child deaths by a variety of studies.

15. Treatment adherence

Advice of healthcare workers on treatment, follow-up and referral should be followed. Non-adherence to treatment failure and drug resistance which can contribute to increased morbidity and mortality. 

16. Antenatal care

Ensure every pregnant woman goes for eight ANC visits from an appropriate healthcare provider. This is in line with the recommendation by WHO 2016 and is reported to a better pregnancy outcome for both the mother and the baby.

### Practices recommended by MOH Kenya

1. Birth notification and birth registration

It is the process of recognizing a child's existence through the recording of their birth in the civil register by the authorized government authority. WHO recommends at least 80% national coverage. However, this target isn't reached in developing countries

In Kenya, 2021, 14% of births were unregistered.

Birth notification and registration is important to the children as they do not miss out on their right to health as the government is able to properly plan for its population(where and how to spend money and what areas to focus on eg immunization)

Birth notification and registration entails the issuance of birth certificates to every registered child, birth notification within 24 hours, birth registration and certification within the first six months of life and surcharge on delays. 

2. Regular Growth monitoring

Defined as the serial weighing and measuring of children's length/height and MUAC and plotting them on a growth chart. Done on a monthly basis, from birth to 5 years of age.

Study done by Remi K. and Tatsuhiko U. demonstrated the importance of growth monitoring as it enabled early detection of constitutional short stature in 72.2% , growth hormone deficiency in 13.9%, short stature due to being small for gestational age in 11.1%, others(Turner syndrome, hypothyroidism, and renal insufficiency) in 2.8%.

As a result of the early detection of the growth faltering, prompt interventions are made thus improving the survival of the children U5. 

3. Household water safety

WHO- About 2 billion people globally use water that is unimproved for drinking or improved water sources with fecal contamination. Nearly 0.5 million diarrhoeal deaths in LMICs are due to unsafe and inadequate drinking water. Children under 5 make up majority of these deaths.

Household water treatment safety and storage is thus an important public health intervention to improve the quality of water and reduce morbidity and mortality due to diarrhoea.

4. Control of indoor air pollution

UNICEF- In 2019, there were 3.2 million premature deaths and 237,000 deaths of children under 5 due to indoor air pollution. As of 2020, 2.4 billion people globally didn't have access to clean cooking, exposing millions of children to high levels of air pollution. Women and children generally are subjected to increased concentrations to the indoor air pollutants around the fireplace.
 
Nearly half of the deaths in children under 5 due to acute lower respiratory infections are as a result of soot that is inhaled from the indoor air pollution.

There is therefore a need to promote the use of cleaner sources of energy in the homes.


### Role of the mother 

Maintaining personal health during the antenatal period including adherence to supplements given, nutrition and hygiene recommendations.

Embracing appropriate feeding for the child for instance, exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months with safe and adequate complementary feeding after 6 months.

Ensuring their children are fully and timely immunized as per the KEPI schedule.

Educating and supporting their children on good health practices such as physical activity, nutrition, behavior. 

Recognizing early symptoms of common childhood illnesses such as pneumonia and diarrhea and seeking appropriate treatment.

Ensuring adherence to medication and other health recommendations.

Monitoring their children growth and developmental milestones and identifying any abnormalities.

Providing support and appropriate environment for physical, social and emotional wellbeing for instance by giving adequate playtime. 

### Role of the father 

Supporting the mother during the prenatal and antenatal period by attending antenatal care and other healthcare visits together.

Assisting the mother in newborn care approaches such as the Kangaroo Mother Care.

Supporting the mother in providing proper nutrition, supplementation and complementary feeding.

Provide physical, emotional and financial security.

Assisting with taking care of a sick child and ensuring appropriate health needs are met in time.

Supporting physical and emotional growth and development in children for instance through playing with the child.

### Community Health Workers

These are frontline resource persons for the community based healthcare. Each CHW support 20 households that are supervised by Community Health Extension Workers (1CHEW for every 25 CHWs).

#### Characteristics of CHW include:

Must be literate

Creative and hardworking

A good example in matters of health and development.

### Roles of CHW

Registration and mapping of households.

Maintaining household registers.

Promoter of healthy behaviors and social welfare e.g breastfeeding, family planning and immunization.

Provider of preventive health care services through community based outreach programs.

Support local referral system.

Diagnosis and management of common childhood illnesses of malnutrition, diarrhea and pneumonia.

Promoting health rights in the community by making sure that the disabled children are not hidden in the home but instead given requisite support and care.

Educating and sensitizing people on diseases such as HIV and TB


### Roles of CHEWs

Overseeing the selection of CHWs.

Organizing and facilitating CHW training.

Supporting the CHWs in assigned duties and coaching them to ensure achievement of the desired outputs and outcomes.

Compiling reports from CHWs and forwarding to level 2 and 3 management committees.


### Role of Level 2 Health Facilities

Provides basic laboratory services

Provides immunization services as per the KEPI guidelines

Provides basic outpatient services

Provides PMTCT (prevention of mother to child transmission) of HIV

Health talks with pregnant women on detecting danger signs

Curative services for minor ailments

Issuance of referral letters to other facilities

### Role of Level 3 Health Facilities

Maternity in-patient services with a ward 

Comprehensive care clinics for patients living with HIV

Provides ANC and family planning services

Provides TB clinics

Provides pharmacy services with the essential drugs 

Issuance of referral letters to higher levels of care

### Role of Partners

NGOs and FBOs play a crucial role in improving the health of children in Kenya by providing access to health services and promoting health education

NGOs work with the government to provide immunization programs, maternal and child health services, nutrition programs, and HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment services

FBOs provide healthcare services in underserved areas, particularly in rural communities, and promote health education by organizing community outreach programs

Both NGOs and FBOs collaborate with local communities to raise awareness about child health and advocate for the rights of children
