# Breastfeeding

### Anatomy of the Breast 

A breast is a glandular organ located on the chest; made up of connective tissue, fat, and breast tissue containing the glands that can make milk. 
1. Lobules: These are the milk-producing glands of the mammary glands. They are made up of small sacs of cells that produce milk when stimulated by hormones.
2. Ducts: These are the tubes that carry the milk from the lobules to the nipple.
3. Nipple: This is the opening at the end of the ducts where the milk is released.
4. Areola: This is the pigmented area around the nipple. It contains sebaceous glands that secrete oils to keep the nipple lubricated and protect it from infection.
5. Fat: This is the layer of fat that surrounds the mammary glands and helps to insulate them.

### Breastmilk production

Breast milk production is a complex process that begins with the release of hormones from the pituitary gland in the brain.
These hormones, prolactin and oxytocin, stimulate the production of milk in the mammary glands.
Prolactin stimulates the production of milk, while oxytocin causes the milk to be released from the mammary glands.
The production of milk begins with the release of colostrum. This is followed by the production of mature milk.


### Let-down reflex

The production of milk is regulated by the baby’s suckling. 
When the baby sucks, it stimulates the release of oxytocin, which causes the milk to be released from the mammary glands.
 This process is known as the let-down reflex.

### Factors which hinder let down reflex

1. Stress can impair the release of oxytocin, which is necessary for the milk let-down reflex. An anxious mother may find it more difficult to let down milk.
2. Moreover, painful or uncomfortable breastfeeding positions, inflamed breasts, or breast infections might interfere with the milk let-down response.
3. Certain medications, particularly some antidepressants, can stop the production of oxytocin and affect milk let-down.
4. Although oxytocin is triggered by physical contact and emotional attachment, being apart from the mother can also impede the milk let-down response.
5. Poor milk supply: The milk let-down reflex may be inhibited if the mother is not producing enough milk because there may not be enough stimulation to cause the release of oxytocin.
6. Certain medical conditions like thyroid issues or diabetes may also affect the milk let-down response.

### Actions that can be taken to eliminate milk let-down reflex inhibitors
1. Decrease stress: Moms should try to reduce stress by engaging in relaxation exercises like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing.
2. See a medical professional for advice if you are experiencing painful or uncomfortable breastfeeding positions, sore nipples, or breast infections.
3. If mothers believe their medicine may be preventing the milk let-down reflex, they can talk with their doctor about different drug options.
4. Enhancing physical touch and bonding with the baby through skin-to-skin contact or co-sleeping can aid in promoting the milk let-down reflex and stimulating the release of oxytocin.
5. Keep up a healthy milk supply: Women can strive 

### Composition of colostrum 

Colostrum is the initial milk usually thick and yellow secreted after birth and usually produced for 2-4 days after lactation starts

It is rich in immunoglobulin (Ig) IgA, IgM, antimicrobial peptides such as lactoferrin which confers strong immunity(passive) to the newborn.

It has high concentration of proteins, low levels of fat and essential vitamins such as vitamin A,B12&K  and developmental factors such as epidermal growth factors that are important for the growth and development of the newborn.

### Composition of mature breast milk 

Mature breast milk has a thin watery texture and is a highly dynamic fluid that adjusts its components to the changing needs of a child.

It is produced 10 days after birth and until the termination of breastfeeding.

Has higher content of fat compared to colostrum to provide a source of energy.

Vitamins and minerals such as A,C,D &E , folic acid and iron 

Proteins such as casein that supply important amino acids for growth and development.

It also has enzymes such as lipases, antibodies e.g. IgA and hormones.


### Fore and Hind Milk

Foremilk is the initial milk that is produced at the start of a feeding. It is lower in fat and lower in carbohydrate. It appears bluish in colour and is more watery compared to the hind milk.

Hind milk is produced 10-20 minutes after initiation of feeding, it is creamy, higher in protein and fat but lower in carbohydrates.

### Correct Positioning of the Baby during Suckling 

When a baby has a good latch, the mother has no pain. The baby’s mouth is wide open and more areola is visible above the baby’s mouth than below.

The mother shouldn't push the baby onto the breast during latching, check the baby's lips after latching as this will pull her breast out of their mouth, cover or restrain the baby's hands and they should also not hold the back of the baby's head.

### Advantages of breastfeeding

For the baby:
- Complete nutrition
- Reduced risk of infections 
- Lower risk of chronic diseases
- Better digestion
- Improved cognitive development

For the mother:
- Allow for bonding with the infant
- Weight loss
- Reduce the risk of some cancers such as ovarian and breast cancer  
- Reduce risk of postpartum depression
- Cost-effective  

Breastfeeding provides numerous benefits for both the mother and the baby. Here are some advantages of breastfeeding:
For the baby:
1. Complete nutrition: Breast milk provides all the essential nutrients that a baby needs for growth and development, including antibodies that protect against illnesses and infections.
2. Lower risk of infections: Breastfed babies have a lower risk of ear infections, respiratory infections, and diarrhea.
3. Reduced risk of chronic diseases: Breastfeeding has been linked to a lower risk of chronic conditions later in life, such as obesity, diabetes, and certain cancers.
4. Better digestion: Breast milk is easily digestible and can reduce the risk of digestive issues, such as constipation and colic.
5. Improved cognitive development: Breastfeeding has been associated with improved cognitive development and higher IQ scores.

For the mother:
1. Bonding with the baby: Breastfeeding promotes bonding between the mother and the baby and can create a strong emotional connection.
2. Lower risk of certain cancers: Breastfeeding has been linked to a lower risk of breast and ovarian cancer in women.
3. Weight loss: Breastfeeding can help mothers lose weight after giving birth.
4. Reduced risk of postpartum depression: Breastfeeding has been associated with a lower risk of postpartum depression in mothers.
5. Cost-effective: Breastfeeding is more cost-effective than formula feeding and can save families a significant amount of money over time.

Overall, breastfeeding is an excellent way to provide optimal nutrition and health benefits for babies while promoting maternal health and bonding.

### Disadvantages of breastfeeding 

For the baby:
- Lack of Vitamin D in breastmilk
- Transmission of diseases


For the baby:
1. Limited exposure to vitamin D: Breast milk is a poor source of vitamin D, which is essential for bone development. Infants who are exclusively breastfed may require vitamin D supplements.
2. Allergies and intolerances: Some babies may develop allergies or intolerances to components in breast milk, such as cow's milk proteins or soy
3. Transmission of diseases such as hepatitis B and C

## Replacement feeds

Replacement feeding involves feeding non-breastfeeding infants with breast milk substitutes such as formula or cow milk.

Replacement feeding is indicated in cases where the mother is unable to breastfeed because of:
- Maternal death or abandonment 
- Infections such as active untreated TB, untreated syphilis, HIV, or herpes with a lesion on the breast. 
- Chemotherapy
- Infant conditions such as galactosemia or allergy to milk protein. 

### AFASS criteria

Replacement feeds should only be advised when they are acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe. This forms the WHO AFASS criteria. 

- Acceptable: the replacement feed is acceptable to the mother and there are no social or cultural barriers perceived. 

- Feasible: the resources are accessible and the mother has the necessary knowledge, skill, and time to prepare the replacement feed. 

- Affordable: the family can comfortably afford the cost of purchase, preparation, and storage of the replacement feed.

- Sustainable: the supply of the replacement feed is uninterrupted by either finance or availability for at least one year.  

- Safe: the storage, preparation, and feeding of the replacement feed are hygienic.

### Disadvantages of replacement feeding 

- Replacement feeds interrupt maternal-infant bonding 
- They can be expensive
- Unlike breast milk, replacement feeds don't contain antibodies
- Inaccurate preparation such as over-dilution may cause malnutrition.
- Lack of hygiene during preparation increases the risk of diarrhea.
- Mother is at risk of mastitis, stigma, or depression. 

### Breastfeeding and Morbidity 

Early initiation of breastfeeding, within 1 hour of birth, exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months of age and continued breastfeeding to 24 months of age is associated with reduced risk of infectious diseases such as diarrhea and pneumonia.

Lack of this is associated with conditions such as malnutrition, ear infections, necrotizing enterocolitis, asthma and atopic dermatitis.

### Breastfeeding and Mortality 

The risk of mortality due to diarrhea, respiratory infections and other conditions can increase in infants who are either partially breastfed or not breastfed at all.
 
## The Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding 

1. Have a written breastfeeding policy that is routinely communicated to staff and parents

2. Train the health care staff to have sufficient knowledge, competence and skills to support breastfeeding

3. Discuss the importance and management of breastfeeding with pregnant women and their families 

4. Facilitate immediate and uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact and support mothers to initiate breastfeeding as soon as possible after birth

5. Train mothers how to initiate and maintain breastfeeding even if they should be separated from their infants 
 
6. Do not provide breastfed newborns any food or fluids other than breast milk, unless medically indicated

7. Practise rooming-in- allow mothers and infants to remain together 24 hours a day

8. Encourage breastfeeding on demand 

9. Counsel mothers on the use and risks of feeding bottles, teats and pacifiers

10. Foster the establishment of breastfeeding support groups and refer mothers to them on discharge from hospital
