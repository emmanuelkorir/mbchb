# Childhood Epidemiology

INTRODUCTION AND DEFINITIONS
Child health epidemiology focuses on the determinants, outcomes, hospital and homecare practises  and health policies that impact the wellbeing and survival of children, mothers and the family as a whole.
Neonate- or a newborn is a baby who is less than 28 days old. 
Infant- a child less than 1 year old
Child-children and teenagers under 18 years old
Under 5’s- refers to children under 5 years old or 59 months.
The distinctions are important because the different age groups have different healthcare needs and are susceptible to different risks. Specific care for each  is required to ensure their survival and proper growth and development.

Prevalence is the proportion of persons in a population who have a particular disease or attribute at a specified period of time.
It is useful in health policy and planning as it gives the overall burden of disease of a population.

   Prevalence = No. of people with disease at a given point in time
                                  Total number of people in the population
Point prevalence refers to cases at a given point in time while period prevalence refers to cases during a given period,e.g first 6 months of 2022.
Incidence refers to the occurrence of  new cases of disease or injury in a population over a specified period of time.
It is useful for research on causes, prevention and treatment of disease.
Prevalence differs from incidence in that it includes both new and pre-existing cases while incidence only refers to new cases.


PREVALENCE AND INCIDENCE

PREVALENCE AND INCIDENCE
There is cumulative incidence (CI) which is related to the population at risk.It is usually expressed as % or proportion or per 1000,10,000 etc
    CI:             No. of people who develop disease in specified period  
              No. of people at risk of getting the disease at the start of the period
Incidence can also be calculated as incidence rate(IR) which is a more precise measure of the population at risk during the study period and is measured in person time. Usually expressed as per 1,000 person years(or 100,10,000 person years etc) 
Person time is the sum of time each person remains at risk for the health outcome and under study observation e.g person years, person months
IR:      No. of people who develop disease in specific time period   
                    Total person-time at risk during the time period

Maternal death- death during a given time period among women while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and the site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes

Maternal mortality rate - is defined as the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 women of reproductive age during the same time period.
     No. of maternal deaths in a  year                  ×	100,000

Case-fatality rate- the proportion of people with a particular condition (cases) who die from that condition, expressed as a percentage.

     No. of people with the same condition


MAJOR CAUSES OF CHILDHOOD MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY GLOBALLY AND IN KENYA

Globally, substantial progress has been made in reducing childhood mortality since 1990. 
The total number of under-5 deaths worldwide has declined from 12.6 million in 1990 to 5.0 million in 2020. 
Since 1990, the global under-5 mortality rate has dropped by 60%, from 93 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 37 in 2020. 
This is equivalent to 1 in 11 children dying before reaching age 5 in 1990, compared to 1 in 27 in 2020. 


MAJOR CAUSES OF CHILDHOOD MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY GLOBALLY AND IN KENYA
Globally, the following remain the leading causes of death for children under five:
● Infectious diseases including pneumonia, diarrhoea , malaria.
● Preterm birth complications; birth asphyxia and trauma.
● Congenital  anomalies ; neural tube defects
● Intrapartum related complications ; preeclampsia, maternal infections, intrapartum hemorrhage


MAJOR CAUSES OF CHILDHOOD MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY GLOBALLY AND IN KENYA

Neonatal complications account for 46-47% of under 5 mortality globally with prematurity causing 15-16% of U5M, birth asphyxia causing 10-11% of U5M and neonatal sepsis causing 6-7% of U5M.
Childhood pneumonia accounts for 14% of U5M
Childhood diarrhea accounts for 8-9% of U5M
Childhood malaria accounts for 3-5% of U5M and 
Childhood malnutrition(mostly undernutrition) causing 50% of U5M.

In Kenya, under-five mortality has fallen from 102 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990, to 41 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2021. However, every year, 64,500 children still die before reaching the age of five, mostly of preventable causes.
Common causes of neonatal mortality include ;
● Preterm birth complications
● Intrapartum growth restrictions
● Infections such as tetanus
● Low birth weight
● Congenital malformations
● Neonatal sepsis

In addition, there exists a relationship between maternal health and neonatal survival.
Poor maternal nutritional and health status has been linked to poor neonatal outcomes and this is influenced by determinants such as socio- economic, demographic and biological factors.
Other maternal-related factors such as age and level of education have also shown significance in neonatal birth outcomes. For instance, cultural practices that restrict access to health facilities after birth have a negative influence on neonatal outcomes.
Ultimately, factors related to maternal health like essential antenatal care (ANC), access to emergency obstetric care, access to skilled attendance at birth, adequate maternal nutrition, postpartum care, neonatal care and early initiation of breastfeeding if adequately implemented can ensure neonatal survival.
