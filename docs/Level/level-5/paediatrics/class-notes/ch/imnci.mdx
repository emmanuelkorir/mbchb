# IMNCI AND INTEGRATED COMMUNITY CASE MANAGEMENT (CCM)

Integrated management of newborn and childhood illnesses (IMNCI) is an integrated approach that focuses on the health and well-being of the child.It aims to reduce preventable mortality, minimize illness and disability, and promote healthy growth and development of children under five years of age. IMNCI includes both preventive and curative elements that can be implemented by families, in communities and in health facilities.

The strategy includes three main components:

Improving case management skills of healthcare providers.

Improving health systems to provide quality care.

Improving family and community health practices for health, growth and development.

### DESCRIBE CCM

Integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) is an equity focused strategy to  improve essential treatment services for children. It involves training, supporting, and supplying community health workers (CHW) to provide diagnostics and treatment for multiple illnesses specifically pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria for sick children of families with difficult access to case management at health facilities. This is especially important in developing countries.

A good CCM strategy :
- Addresses access to, quality of, and demand for CCM services;
- Seeks to ensure that CCM has the support of decision-makers, health care providers, and community members; 
- Is put into action alongside improvements in the health system.



### REASONS FOR CCM/ iCCM

Deploying community health workers can increase coverage and access to treatment

CCM targets the conditions that cause the most child death in developing countries: pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria, and neonatal causes.

CCM relies on evidence-based and one of the most cost effective child survival interventions - proven to save the lives of newborns and children under five, at a price that is affordable in developing countries.

CCM brings curative health care to children in those communities that are hardest to reach.

CCM is consistent with practices recommended by WHO, UNICEF, and other international health agencies.


### LIST THE MAJOR CAUSES OF DEATH IN UNDER-FIVES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES-WHERE THEY DIE AND WHY. 

THE MAJOR CAUSES OF DEATH IN UNDER-FIVES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

Under-five mortality is the probability a newborn would die before reaching exactly 5 years of age, expressed per 1,000 live births.

Major causes include;
- Preterm birth complications; prematurity, birth asphyxia and neonatal sepsis
- Childhood pneumonia
- Childhood diarrhea
- Childhood malaria
- Others include; malnutrition(undernutrition), Tuberculosis

Global causes of under-5 deaths in 2019

Deaths of neonates (aged 0–27 days) are on the right-hand side and deaths of children aged 1–59 months are on the left-hand side.

The total number of under-5 deaths worldwide has declined from 12.6 million in 1990 to 5 million in 2020 (WHO 2020).

However, Sub-Saharan Africa(58%)and Southern Asia(26%), account for more than 80% of the 5 million under-5 deaths in 2020 and only account for 53% of the global live births.

Half of all under-5 deaths in 2020 occurred in just 5 countries: Nigeria, India, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ethiopia.

Nigeria and India alone account for almost a third of all deaths.

In 2021, 1 in 14 children in sub-Saharan Africa died before reaching their fifth birthday—15 times higher than the risk for children born in high-income countries and 20 years behind the world average.

Top 10 countries with the highest numbers of deaths (thousands) for children under 5 years, 2020

Low socio-economic status eg low levels of education and income-poor health seeking practices.

Malnutrition-high risk of death due to common childhood illnesses

Inadequate number of skilled health care workers

Inadequate access to maternal and newborn health services-lack of treatment of common illnesses eg diarrhea and pneumonia leading to death.

Growing population in Africa(will require an additional 4.2 million health workers above current growth to meet WHO minimum standards)

Low levels of education and information
(Data obtained from UNICEF)






### THE GLOBAL STATUS OF CCM


CCM is consistent with practices recommended by WHO, UNICEF, and other international health agencies.

WHO, UNICEF, and other international agencies have jointly called on countries to adopt and promote policies and programs that have strong community-based components to deliver interventions for diarrhea , malaria, pneumonia, newborn care, and acute severe malnutrition, while improving services at first-level health facilities.

The global status of CCM varies by country and region.

Some countries have made significant progress in implementing CCM programs, while others have yet to fully adopt this approach.

CCM has been recognized as an effective approach to improving access to health services, particularly in low-resource settings.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 65 countries had policies and guidelines in place to support the implementation of CCM programs for childhood illnesses, including pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria.

CCM has been successfully implemented in a number of countries, including our neighboring countries; Ethiopia, Malawi, and Rwanda.

Young children are especially vulnerable to these illnesses, and CCM offers caregivers in these hard-to-reach communities a way to help children under five get the treatment they need before it is too late.

CCM has become one of the key global health strategies recognized by stakeholders across the health system. When well-designed and implemented, an iCCM program expands access to life saving interventions for vulnerable populations living in settings with poor access to health care.

### STATUS OF CCM IN KENYA

Kenya has made tremendous progress in the reduction of its under-five mortality rate, from approximately 102 per 1,000 live births in 1999 to 41 per 1,000 live births (KDHS 2022) although yet to meet SDG goal (25 per 1000 live births)

Primary health care is allocated less than 10% of total health budget.

iCCM services are dependent on a functional community health system which in turn links with the network of primary health care facilities.

The scope of iCCM in Kenya covers conditions such as diarrhoea, malaria, pneumonia, malnutrition, newborn health and positive health behaviour and practices.

Three sampled counties, Kisumu, Turkana and Busia were studied to collect data on progress of this program. (Integrated Community Case Management in Kenya Gap Analysis and Investment Case ,22 November 2021 )

The causes of this inadequate coverage in terms of service delivery may be due to: inadequate funding to iCCM services, inadequate staffing and lack of awareness of services among the public

There also needs to be greater linkages and collaboration between CHVs and health facilities as there is reported hesitance of health workers to provide CHVs with medication e.g  Amoxicillin DT for pneumonia.

The programme is also heavily donor dependent therefore the national government needs to increase funding

Nevertheless, iCCM can greatly reduce childhood mortality and morbidity when implemented appropriately therefore the government needs to allocate more resources towards it.


### ROLE OF CCM IN THE LEVELS OF PREVENTION

#### PRIMARY PREVENTION 

At the primary level, a disease or condition is prevented before it occurs. This would entail elimination of all possible risk factors leading to it.

CHWs can educate Mothers;
- on the importance of ANC visits during pregnancy,
- breastfeeding after delivery,
- nutritional requirements during growth,
- good hygienic practices as well as the importance of timely immunization.

#### SECONDARY PREVENTION 

At this level, the aim is to detect a disease in its earliest stages through recognition of signs and symptoms, accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment to avoid progression to its severest state.

CHWs can educate parents and caregivers to recognize the earliest manifestations of common diseases and seek urgent treatment.

CHWs can advise on regular check-ups and screening or monitoring of children to catch disease conditions in its earliest stages. 

#### TERTIARY LEVEL 

Aims to reduce the burden of an established disease in an individual. 

This includes rehabilitation efforts for permanent injuries like lower limb paralysis of polio.

A CHW can facilitate easy access to professional monitoring for timely interventions for children with chronic illnesses in case of complications. 

A CHW can also educate and demonstrate on giving care to children living with conditions like cerebral palsy.

CHWs can help institutions like schools come up with sound care plans for children living with chronic conditions.
