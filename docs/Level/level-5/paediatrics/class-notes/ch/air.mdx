# ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND CHILDREN II (INDOOR AND OUTDOOR AIR POLLUTION)

Air pollution is one of the greatest environmental risks to health.The presence of pollutants in the air in excessive amounts for a long duration of time is sufficient to affect the health and quality of life of people.

Indoor pollution- is defined as the presence of contaminants in the internal environment (households, offices). Contaminants include any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural composition of air in the internal environment .

Outdoor (ambient) air pollution- is the contamination of the outdoor environment by chemical, physical or biological agents that modify the normal composition of air in the external environment.
 
An Air Pollutant is any solid, liquid,gaseous or radioactive substance present in the atmosphere or ambient air in such a concentration as to be injurious to humans or plants or property.The Major air Pollutants are:

PARTICULATE MATTER-Solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air.Major sources are industrial and vehicle emissions. Those <10mm are inhalable and cause disease.

OZONE-is formed secondarily through the reaction of nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons in the presence of sunlight.

NITROGEN  OXIDES-from fuel combustion, natural emission from soil and lightning.

SULPHUR DIOXIDE--combustion of fossil fuel,industrial boilers and volcanic eruption

VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS/HYDROCARBONS-sources include air fresheners, refrigerants,furnishing material,paints and pesticides.

### PRIMARY VS SECONDARY AIR POLLUTANT
                                                                                
Primary air pollutant is a Pollutant emitted directly from its source eg volcanoes and vehicles.

Secondary air pollutant- is a product of the reaction of two or more Primary pollutants in the atmosphere eg ozone from NO2 and hydrocarbons.

### SOURCES OF INDOOR AIR POLLUTION

- Using firewood/charcoal to cook.This emits carbon monoxide.
- Indoor smoking that emits Nitrogen oxide,formaldehyde and tar.
- Use of  LPG Cooking gases produces methane,nitrous oxide and CO2.
- Use of air fresheners and pesticides emits toxic products like aldehydes.
- Outdoor sources like living close to a cement factory or oil refinery. 
- Natural sources like volcanoes that emit harmful gases into homes.
- Dust from carpets and Moisture from humidifiers and air conditioners. 


### SOURCES OF OUTDOOR AIR POLLUTION

- Industrial emission of large quantities of hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide.
- Fuel in internal combustion engines of cars,planes and trains produce oxides of sulphur and nitrogen. 
- Open air burning of both organic and inorganic waste.
- Economic activities like charcoal burning.
- Natural disasters like volcanic eruptions ,wild forest fires/ bushfires. 
- Human accidents like nuclear disasters release radioactive substances into the air.
- Large scale agricultural use of pesticides and herbicides release harmful Volatile Organic Products.
- Dust particles  from Construction works ,mining activities and road dust.

### WHY CHILDREN ARE VULNERABLE TO AIR POLLUTION

Children are more vulnerable to air pollution than adults due to a combination of physiological, behavioral, and environmental factors. 

Some of the key reasons why children are more susceptible to the harmful effects of air pollution include:

- Developing lungs: Children’s lungs are still developing and exposure to air pollution during this critical period can cause long lasting damage to their respiratory system.

- Breathing rate: Children have a faster breathing rate and thus breathe more air per unit of body weight than adults, this means they inhale a greater volume of polluted air.

- Exposure patterns: Older children spend more time outdoors and engage in more physical activity than adults,this increases their exposure to air pollutants.

- Immature immune system: Children have a less developed immune system than adults, making them more susceptible to respiratory infections and other health problems related to air pollution.

- Height :  Children are generally shorter than adults and hence are closer to the ground where some of the air pollutants reach their peak concentrations due to their increased density relative to air.

## GLOBAL BURDEN OF AIR POLLUTION

According to WHO, 99% of the world population breathes air that exceeds its guideline’s limits and contains a high level of pollutants, with low and middle-income countries having the most exposure.

Around ⅓ (2.4 billion) of the population cooks using open fires or fuels such as kerosene,biomass and coal which are a big source of indoor pollution and women and children bear the greatest health burden because they are more involved in household chores.

Those in low and middle income countries also disproportionately experience the burden of outdoor air pollution

Burden of disease due to air pollution is almost the same as other major global health risks such as unhealthy diets and tobacco smoking.

#### Impact on health

Outdoor and indoor air pollution contributes to 6.7 million premature deaths annually. 

4.2 million of them are attributable to outdoor pollution particularly due to fine particulate matter

Household air pollution was responsible for an estimated 3.2 million deaths per year in 2020, with 237,000 of them involving children under the age of 5.

The exposure results in non-communicable diseases such as stroke, ischaemic heart disease,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer

Some of Kenya’s statistics:

22 µg/m3 each person's annual mean exposure to particulate matter which is 4.4 times WHO’s guidelines.

11 deaths per 100,000 people attributable to fine particle pollution in 2019 (5,490 in total in the country).

### EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTION ON CHILD HEALTH.

Children are physiologically more vulnerable to air pollution than adults because their brains, lungs and other organs are still developing.

These effects can either be prenatal, perinatal or postnatal.

1. Birth defects

Outdoor air pollution from carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone and particulate matter lead to ventricular septal defects, aortic artery and valve defects, pulmonary artery and valve anomalies.

Maternal exposure to particulate matter is associated with low birth weight and preterm birth.

2. Respiratory system

Prenatal exposure to air pollution is associated with impairment of lung development and lung function in childhood even at low levels of exposure.

Asthma - exacerbated in children due to exposure to household air pollution(from household fuels and technologies) and due to exposure to particulate matter and ozone.

Upper and lower respiratory infections– exposure to air pollutants such as particulate matter, nitric oxide and ozone is associated with pneumonia and other respiratory infections in young children. Increased prevalence and incidence of cough and bronchitis due to particulate matter exposure.

Neurodevelopmental and behavioural effects- Can be due to both prenatal and postnatal exposure to air pollution leading to behavioural disorders such as autism spectrum disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 

There are adverse effects of environmental contaminants(including certain heavy metals such as lead and mercury and persistent organic pollutants) on the development of the nervous system and behaviour in children.

Effects on infant mortality.

Risk of infant mortality increases with increase in pollution levels.

Studies show an association between sulfur dioxide and total suspended particles (TSP) on  infant mortality.

3. Childhood cancers

There is an increased risk of childhood leukaemia with exposure to traffic-related air pollutants such as benzene causing acute myeloid leukemia.

### PREVENTIVE AND CONTROL MEASURES OF AIR POLLUTION

Air pollution is one of the greatest environmental risk to health.By reducing air pollution levels, countries can reduce the burden of disease from stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and both chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including asthma.

Addressing air pollution, which is the second highest risk factor for noncommunicable diseases, is key to protecting public health.

Some of the policies and strategies that target to reduce Air Pollution include:
1. Urban planning-By improving the energy efficiency of buildings and making cities more green and compact, and thus energy efficient

2. Energy-Ensuring access to affordable clean household energy solutions for cooking, heating and lighting;

3. Power generation-Increased use of low-emissions fuels and renewable combustion-free power sources ( solar, wind or hydropower) Co-generation of heat and power. Distributed energy generation (e.g. mini-grids and rooftop solar power generation)

4. Industry-Utilization of clean technologies that reduce industrial smokestack emissions. Improved management of urban and agricultural waste, including capture of methane gas emitted from waste sites as an alternative to incineration (for use as biogas). 

5. Transport-Shifting to clean modes of power generation, rioritizing rapid urban transit, walking and cycling networks in cities, rail interurban freight and passenger travel, shifting to cleaner heavy-duty diesel vehicles, low-emissions vehicles and fuels, including fuels with reduced sulfur content

6. Home Level-Use cleaner fuels and technologies to cook, heat and light your home – choose electricity, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, biogas or solar stoves or ovens if possible. Cook in a well-ventilated area or cook outside if air quality is better and it is possible. • Keep children away from smoking fireplaces. Stop smoking near children.

Don’t burn candles or incense or use air fresheners that add toxic chemicals to  the air.

Avoid burning household and agricultural waste, especially close to where children live and play.

Compost and use local services for recycling and garbage disposal if possible.

Avoid busy roads and take quieter streets with less traffic and vehicle emissions if possible

7. Municipal And Agricultural Waste Management-Strategies for waste reduction, waste separation, recycling and reuse of waste reprocessing. Improved methods of biological waste management such as anaerobic waste digestion to produce biogas, are feasible, low-cost alternatives to the open incineration of solid waste, where incineration is unavoidable. Combustion technologies with strict emission controls are critical
