<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

b. The ratio of cervical to uterine length increases after menopause

Ovaries: Shrink in size, become wrinkled and white, with thinning of cortex, increase in medullary components, and abundance of stromal cells with secretory activity.

Fallopian Tubes: Show features of atrophy, with muscle coat becoming thinner, cilia disappearing, and plicae becoming less prominent.

Uterus: Becomes smaller with a 1:1 ratio between the body and cervix, thin and atrophic endometrium, and scanty cervical secretion, but can become proliferative or hyperplastic in women with high endogenous estrogens.

Vagina: Becomes narrower and less elastic, with a thin epithelium, flattened rugae, no glycogen, absent Doderlein's bacillus, alkaline pH, and a 10/85/5 maturation index.

Vulva: Shows features of atrophy, with flattened labia, scanty pubic hair, and a narrow introitus.

Breasts: Fat is reabsorbed, glands atrophy, nipples decrease in size, ultimately becoming flat and pendulous.

Bladder and Urethra: Undergo similar changes to the vagina, with thin epithelium prone to damage and infection, and possible dysuria, frequency, urge, or stress incontinence.

Pelvic Muscles and Ligaments: Scanty pelvic cellular tissues and loss of ligament tone lead to pelvic relaxation, uterine descent, and anatomic changes in the urethra and neck of the bladder, which can aggravate preexisting weakness.
