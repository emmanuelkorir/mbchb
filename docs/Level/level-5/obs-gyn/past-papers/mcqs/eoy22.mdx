E. Metabolizes glucose in preference of pyruvate 

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

A. Remains totipotent to the 8-cell stage 

Up to the eight-cell stage, all blastomeres have equivalent potential and can give rise to all lineages. Embryos at this stage then undergo compaction, a process in which the initially round blastomeres flatten against one another to generate a rough sphere. All cells initially polarize, but at the 16–32-cell stage, cell division parallel to the circumference of the blastocyst separates a small group of inner (apolar) from outer (polarized) cells. Cells remaining on the outer surface after the 32-cell stage become trophectoderm, whereas those inside become inner cell mass.

Breaks through zona pellucida during the blastocsyt stage on day 4-5 after fertilization

Intracellular specialization occurs during compaction from 8 cell stage.

Enters uterus on day 4 after fertilization. Implantation occurs on day 6-12

Pyruvate, Fatty acids are used during metabolism
