### Question 1 
 
The following statement is TRUE concerning breech presentation 

a. The attitude of complete breech involves varying degrees of extension of thighs or legs 

b. Erb’s and Klumpke’s palsies are due to spinal cord injury 

c. External cephalic version should be done in labour 

d. Congenital anomalies are more common than in non-breech presentations 

e. Ventouse delivery is indicated in delayed second stage 

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

d. Congenital anomalies are more common than in non-breech presentations. Although most breech fetuses are normal, this presentation is associated with an increased risk for congenital malformations and mild deformations, torticollis, and developmental dysplasia of the hip.

The attitude of a complete breech presentation involves varying degrees of flexion of the thighs and legs.

External version may be attempted if: The gestation is at or after 37 weeks, there are no contraindications for vaginal delivery, membranes are intact, amniotic fluid volume is adequate,
and there are facilities for Emergency Caesarean section. It may however complicate with placental abruption, foetal bradycardia, knotted or entangled cord, amniotic fluid embolism and foetal or maternal death. 

Damage to the upper part of the brachial plexus causes erb's palsy. Damage to the lower part of the brachial plexus causes klumpke palsy.

Ventouse/vacuum delivery is not indicated in breech and face presentations, and most brow presentations.
Note: Forceps can be used for the after coming head in complex breech deliveries.

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

e. Diagnostic HSG may also be therapeutic 

HSG is associated with increased pregnancy rates of upto 30% for the first 3 months for couples with unexplained infertility. It is presumed that the dye itself flushes out debris(also known as tubal goo) and if that was all that was preventing pregnancy, one can conceive within 3 months.

Normal serum AMH levels are 2-6.8 ng/molar

Endoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis. HSG is not useful for diagnosing endometriosis.

A serum of progesterone above 20-25 nmol/L confirms ovulation occured in that cycle.

Inability to achieve pregnancy after 12 months of unprotected sex in women below 35 years, and 6 months in women above or equal to 35 years.

When should the fetal heart rate be auscultated during labor? 

a. During a contraction 

b. Immediately after a contraction 

c. 15 minutes after a contraction 

d. Before a contraction 

e. Anytime 

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

b. Immediately after a contraction 

This timing is important because the fetal heart rate can be temporarily affected during a contraction due to decreased blood flow to the fetus, and it may take a short time for the heart rate to return to baseline after the contraction ends. Waiting a few seconds after the end of the contraction before auscultating the fetal heart rate allows for a more accurate assessment of the baseline fetal heart rate.

### Question 27 
 
Which Leopold’s maneuver involves fundal palpation to define which fetal pole occupies the fundus 

a. First 

b. Fifth 

c. Second 

d. Third 

e. Fourth 

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

a. First 

The first maneuver also called the fundal grip, assesses the uterine fundus to determine its height and which fetal pole—that is, cephalic or podalic—occupies the fundus. The breach gives the sensation of a large, nodular mass, and its surface is uneven, non-ballotable, and not very mobile whereas the head feels hard and round with a smooth surface of uniform consistency, is very mobile and ballotable.

The second maneuver, sometimes called the umbilical/lateral grip, involves palpation of the lateral uterine surfaces.  It allows establishing if the fetus is in a longitudinal, transverse, or oblique situation, and to determine the position of the back and small parts.

The third maneuver also called the Pawlik's grip. The first Pawlík grip, sometimes called the first pelvic grip, helps to define which presenting part of the fetus is situated in hypogastrium. In the second Pawlík grip, the clinician carries on by sliding the hand upward to determine the cervical groove: if the mass moves, the presenting part is not engaged. Then lateral movements and ballottement are performed. The differentiation between head and breech is made as in the first maneuver. This maneuver also allows for an assessment of the fetal weight and the volume of amniotic fluid.

The fourth maneuver identifies which presenting part is in the lower uterine pole.

Completing the fourth maneuver with the so-called "fifth maneuver" of Leopold, or maneuver of Zagenmeister, also can allow the approximate distance between the presenting part and the maternal pelvis. In the cephalic presentation, the hand is placed flat on the pubic symphysis, and the palpation could delineate the fetal head portion that can be reached above the pelvic inlet. Using the rule of fifths, the distance between the base and vertex of the fetal head is divided into five equal parts. Each fifth corresponding to 2 cm or approximately one transverse fingerbreadth. If the fetal head accommodates two fingerbreadths above the pelvic brim, it is said to be engaged.

### Question 37 
 
What would surgical removal of corpus luteum of pregnancy result to if removed at 7 weeks of gestation 

a. Would lead to spontaneous abortion 

b. Can result in abdominal pregnancy 

c. It will have no effect on the pregnancy 

d. Would lead to hypertension in pregnancy 

e. Would lead to gestational diabetes 

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
a. Would lead to spontaneous abortion 

At 7-9 weeks(6-8 weeks Duttas), there is transfer of corpus luteum to the placenta(luteal placental shift). Progesterone withdrawal before the 7th week will lead to pregnancy loss. Luteectomy conducted following 9 weeks of gestation does not result in miscarriage.

At 7 weeks of gestation, the surgical removal of the corpus luteum may lead to a spontaneous abortion or miscarriage. This is because the pregnancy is still very early, and the placenta has not yet fully taken over the production of progesterone. Without adequate progesterone levels, the pregnancy may not be able to continue to develop.
