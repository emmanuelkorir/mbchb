E. malnutrition (obesity and weight loss)

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

D. Elimination of dead space

Dead space is the area between the wound bed and the dressing that is not filled with tissue or dressing material. Elimination of dead space is important in wound healing as it helps to prevent hematoma and seroma formation. To eliminate dead space, dermal stitches are used for phasing out the dead space, as well as for redistributing wound tension and apposing the wound edges. However, they do not eliminate the formation of dead spaces completely, especially if the excision extends to the deep fat or fascia. Wound dressings might help facilitate this process if they eliminate dead space, control exudate, prevent bacterial overgrowth, ensure proper fluid balance, demonstrate cost-efficiency.
