SCENARIO A

Yesterday the 5TH AUGUST 2021, you are the doctor on call in the KNH labor ward when, Wakasaka a gravida 2 para 0+1 is brought into the labour ward accompanied by the husband. On admission the main findings are as follows: she is conscious, jaundiced, with a BP of 165/115mmg and tender right upper quadrant.
Her LNMP was on the 15thof December 2020.

Para 0+1 with pre-eclampsia(1) with severe features(1) and possible
HELLP syndrome(1) at 32 weeks gestation(1)
2. List 10 other important aspects of her history necessary for comprehensive management (20 marks)

• History of headache
• Visual abnormalities (scotomata, photophobia, blurred vision, or temporary blindness)
• Epigastric pain
• Nausea or vomiting
• Altered mental status/Convulsions
• Fetal movements
• Per vaginal bleeding
• Dyspnoea, retrosternal chest pain
• Urine output
• Labour pains
• Obs/Gyn history:
• Last menstrual period, EDD
• If and when Pdt was done
• Quickening
• If she has any earlier obstetric scans
• Past Medical history
• Renal disease
• Diabetes
• Hypertension
• SLE
• Family and social history
• Family history of chronic illnesses
• PET
• Marital status, cigarette smoking
(this question is testing whether the student understands the natural progression of PET, clinical features of severity, risk factors and complications)
3. List the systems you will examine and some of the salient features you will look for (5x 4 marks each)=20 marks)
a. General examination for general status of the patient, level of consciousness, pallor, edema, jaundice, the other vital
signs(PR, RR, temp)
b. CNS for level of consciousness, reflexes, lateralizing signs, fundoscopy for retinal changes
c. Respiratory system: dyspnoea, basal crepitations
d. Per abdominal examination: epigastric tenderness, fundal height, lie, presentation, fetal heart rate, uterine tenderness, uterine contractions.
e. Vaginal examination for bishop score: cervical position, length, consistency, dilatation.
4. State and rationalize any 7 investigations to be carried out to aid in
Wakasaka's management (21 marks)
a. Complete blood count: to assess platelet count and haematocrit level
b. Serum LDH to rule out microangiopathic haemolysis
c. Liver function tests (liver enzymes, bilirubin, albumin) to assess for evidence of HELL syndrome
d. Kidney function tests to assess for renal failure
e. Urinalysis to assess for level of proteinuria
f. Serum Uric acid levels as a predictor of impending IUD
g. Coagulation profile, serum fibrinogen levels to rule out a coagulopathy
h. Obstetric ultrasound/Biophysical profile/Doppler studies/fetal biometrics: to assess fetal status(NRFS, lUGR), weight, presentation in anticipation for delivery
5. Outline and justify the management plan for this patient. (30 marks)
• Admit for in patient management
• Iv access for drug adminstration
• Antihypertensives: to control blood pressure, prevent CVA
• Magnesium sulphate for the first 24 hours: for seizure prophylaxis
• Antenatal corticosteroids before delivery: to hasten fetal lung maturity to prevent RDS in the event of preterm delivery
• Catheterization: to monitor urine output during administration of mgso4
• Investigations to assess for end organ damage
• Assessment of Fetal wellbeing: daily fetal kick charts, NST, BPP, RI to assess fetal status and determine optimum timing for delivery
• Fluid management: to avoid fluid overload/pulmonary edema
• Monitoring of maternal BP, daily weight, daily urinalysis: to monitor worsening of the disease
• Delivery at 34 weeks or earlier in case of deteriorating maternal or fetal status: to prevent maternal and fetal compromise from disease progression eg cerebral hemorrhage, hepatic rupture, renal failure, pulmonary edema, seizure, bleeding related to thrombocytopenia, fetal growth restriction, abruptio placentae, iufd....(6 marks)
6. State 5 Public health interventions that can be put in place to reduce the morbidity and mortality of her condition. (5marks)
a. Quality and timely antenatal care
b. Calcium supplementation
c. Universal screening for PET(BP monitoring, urinalysis)
d. Public education/awareness of signs and symptoms of PET
e. Referral system
f. Quality intrapartum care
g. Capacity building of health care workers
(award marks for any other intervention that makes sense, max 5 marks)
SCENARIO B
Jane Kwamboka is a para 2+0 gravida 3 at 33 weeks who presents with a 5 day history of dysuria, frequency and urgency of micturition for which she received oral antibiotic in a nearby clinic. In the last two days she's noted hotness of the body, abdominal pain, occasional chills and rigors.

Oral antibiotics (1) beta-lactams or, if in the second trimester, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
