### Question 4

Mrs. Wanjugu is a 29 year old para 1 + 0 gravida 2 at 33 weeks gestation by date
and by a first trimester obstetric ultrasound. She suffers from chronic kidney
disease and high blood pressure antedating pregnancy. She presents in the
antenatal clinic complaining of severe headache and epigastric pain. You check

<summary>Check Answer</summary>

Mrs. Wanjugu, a 29 year old para 1 + 0 gravida 2 at 33 weeks gestation diagnosed with severe pre- eclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension with underlying chronic kidney disease

</details>
2. What relevant history would you take from Mrs Wanjugu? (1 x 1, max 15)

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

  - Confirm Mrs. Wanjugu’s biodata once again
  - Hx of Presenting Illness:
    - Headache: Nature/ character of onset, duration, site of pain (whether frontal or occipital, severity of the pain, ad any associated symptoms e.g. Visual complaints, changes in mental status – confusion, apprehension, convulsions, nausea or vomiting
    - Epigastric pain: When it started, nature of onset (gradual or acute) and duration, character of the pain, relieving factors, exact site and relieving factors and aggravating factors. Any associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting which may be present in severe preeclampsia
    - History of chronic hypertension: Duration of dx, severity of hypertension, treatment and treatment adherence as well as level of hypertensive control achieved. This is important because chronic hypertension is a risk factor for preeclampsia and its severity. Chronic hypertension is also responsible for dysfunction of other organ systems like the urinary and cardiovascular system therefore lack of adequate treatment or control of pressure would lead to increased risk of co- morbidities in pre- eclampsia
    - History of chronic kidney disease: duration of disease, grading of chronic kidney disease, treatment and progression of the chronic kidney disease. Important as chronic kidney disease is a risk factor for preeclampsia and the disease will affect hypertension as well as increasing the risk of renal damage and other comorbidities associated with preeclampsia. T will also have a bearing on management as certain drugs used for treatment are contraindicated and there maybe need for dialysis if renal function falls beyond a certain level.
  - Systemic Enquiry

    - Respiratory System: Elicit if there has been any retrosternal chest pain, shortness of breath, cyanosis due to pulmonary edema
    - Genitourinary System: Any change in urine output, frequency of micturition, colour of urine, any pain while micturition. Other symptoms such as flank pain, any discharge to rule out urinary tract infections. Any other features that are associated with renal failure such as body swelling, malnutrition etc should be probed for.
    - Cardiovascular System: History of weakness, malaise due to inade inadequate tissue perfusion caused by the hypertensive state.
    - CNS: History of changes in cognitive functions like confusion, apprehension, neurologic deficits such as cranial nerve palsy’s, history of convulsions, visual disturbances should be assessed. May reveal complications of preeclampsia such as intracerebral haemorrhage and progression of disease to eclampsia.
    Gastrointestinal System: changes in appetite, bowel movements, yellowing of the eyes could reveal areas that need to be considered during management.

  - Past Medical History
    - In addition to history of chronic hypertension and chronic kidney dx inquire on any othermedical diseases the patient has ever had.

  - Drug history
    - All medications that the patient has been receiving and had received in the past. Adherence to her treatment and whether she knows of the side effects and adverse reactions, as well as history of known allergies.

  - Family History 
    - Elicit if there has been such a disease in the family. If present what was the outcome and how i affected people.
  - Social History
    - The patient’s education level, marital status, occupation- day to day activity and any history  - of smoking, alcohol or any other drug use.
  - Gynaecological History
    - Age at menarche, cycle length, duration of flow, dysmenorrhoea, volume regularity. Ask her of the LNMP. 
    - Any previous contraceptive use, and if yes which type and for how long. 
    - Also inquire whether she has ever had any sexually transmitted infections, if yes what treatment did she get and was her partner treated also. Since STI’s could complicate pregnancies.
  - Obstetric History and Previous Pregnancy 
    - Length of gestation in previous pregnancy, duration of labour, mode of delivery, birth weight and fetal outcome and fate of the baby. 
    - Any complications during labour and pueperium period. This will allow anticipation of any complications that may arise and also adequate management plans.

</details>

3. State and justify the investigations you will do on Mrs Wanjugu (1 x 1, max 10)

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

  - Full Blood Count and Haemogram Reveal anaemia and thrombocytopenia due to haemolysis as well as to assess need for blood transfusion. Check for HELLP syndrome
  - Peripheral Blood Film To spot presence of haemolysis and morphology of red cells. Also an increase in reticulocyte count may point to haemolysis of red cells.
  - GXM In case need arises for an emergency Caesarean section
  - Coagulation screen (BT, PT, APTT) In case of thrombocytopenia the bleeding time may be increased and the coagulation time may also be increased in case DIC which is a complication of pre- eclampsia
  - Serum electrolytes and Serum creatinine
  - Monitor renal function and assess need for dialysisas well as monitor progression of pre-eclampsia. In case of kidney damage urea, and creatinine levels will be high. R/p HELLP Syndrome
  - Baseline for monitoring for MgSO4, toxicity
  - Urinalysis and 24 hour urine To determine proteinuria which is an indicator of severity of disease as well as indicating response to treatment. Urine should also undergo microscopy and culture to rule out UTI which maycomplicate pregnancy.
  - LFTS – AST, GGT, ALT, and Bilirubin R/o HELLP syndrome
  - Chest X ray To assess pulmonary edema
  - Non Stress test Assess fetal wellbeing
  - Obstetric U/S, BPP/ RI Assess fetal status to determine mode of delivery, estimate fetal weight, confirm gestation, and assess fetal maturity. Also to assess amniotic fluid volume to show if there may be presence off fetal growth restriction

</details>

4. Outline the management plan for Mrs Wanjugu (10 marks)

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

Supportive/ Conservative Management
 - Admit Mrs Wanjugu in the hospital ask her to be lying in lateral decubitus position.
 - Do a quick assessment of the airway, breathing and circulation
 - High protein and low sodium diet
 - Start her on oxygen by mask if needed
 - Fix 2 large bore IV cannulas in case of additional fluids required. Fluid management to avoid fluid overload.
 - Draw blood samples from laboratory tests
 - Daily Observation
 - Maternal: BP should be measured regularly. Fix an indwelling catheter for monitoring urine volume (input/ output) and proteinuria
 - Fetal Monitoring: Assess fetal well- being, NST, BPP/RI, daily fetal movement counts
 - Drug Supportive Management  Control BP – IV hydralazine for control of BP higher than 160/110mmHg (1), Aldomet/ Nifedipine 
 - If the urine output satisfactory from history/ what is emptied on catheterization, start Magnesium sulphate for convulsion prophylaxis
 - MgSO4 – loading dose: 4g IV infusion given over 15 – 20 minutes
 - MgSO4 maintenance dose: 1- 2g/ hour to continue up to 24 hours after delivery or the last convulsion whichever occurs last  Sedatives: Diazepam to alleviate any anxiety that may be present

Definitive Management
 - Corticosteroid Administration: Dexamethasone to help in fetal lung maturity in anticipation of premature or preterm delivery. 6mg IM every 24 hours for 2 days
 - Deliver: Target to deliver within 48 hours; preparation for delivery. Control BP and IV access. Also take blood for grouping and cross-match. Cervical ripening using Misoprostol should be initiated and oxytocin administered to induce labour. Do a Bishop score, examine mother, to determine mode of delivery. Caesarean section indicated if fetal distress or failure of induction of labour. AMTSL to prevent PPH or any other complications
 - Social and Psychosocial support to the patient. To involve family members in the management by ensuring proper support to the patient. Patient education on various outcomes should also be done.
 - Institute monitoring – BP, and for Magnesium sulphate toxicity, convulsions, RR, Fetal
monitoring
 - Multidisciplinary Approach: Involve other disciplines as necessary, Paediatrician, renal
physician, ICU, Neurosurgeon and nutritionist
 - Postpartum care: continue to monitor vitals and blood pressure and adjust dose of antihypertensive as needed. Continue anticonvulsant prophylaxis. Give dexamethasone to avoid PPH. Platelet count to assess risk of bleeding and determine need for transfusion. Measure urine output, proteins and RFTs to check for resolution of preeclampsia.

### Question 

A 36 Year old Para 0 + 1 presents with a 10 year history of inability to conceive
despite regular unprotected coitus since her marriage, and a 2 year history of
heavy menstrual flow. Abdominal examination reveals a pelvic mass
corresponding to an 18 week gravid uterus.
a) Based on the above information what other relevant history would you wish to elucidate
from the patient? (30 marks)
History of Presenting Illness
Infertility (10 marks)
 Menstrual History: cycle length, duration, flow with/ without dysmenorrhoea (1)
 Any contraception in use currently and in the past (1)
 History of treatment for STIs, PV discharge, pelvic pain or dyspareunia (1)
 Galactorrhoea, headaches, vision abnormalities (1)
 Any voice changes, hair distribution changes (1)
 Has she had any abdomino- pelvic surgery (1)
 Last pregnancy- events surrounding miscarriage, at what gestation, was an MVA, or D &C
done, was it an ectopic (1)
 Has spouse sired other children, his age, profession, does he smoke, take alcohol, is he
diabetic? (1)
Pelvic Mass (10 marks)
 Has patient noted any pelvic mass? Is it fast / slow growing, is it painful
 Any urinary symptoms- urinary incontinence, frequency, dysuria, retention
 Any GIT symptoms – constipation
 Feeling of heaviness in the pelvis
 Any care sought for these complains?
 Investigations done
 Management offered
Heavy Menstrual Flow (10 marks)
 Palpitations, Dizziness, malaise
 Oedema, Easy fatigability
 Shortness of breath, orthopnoea
b) What clinical signs would you elicit on general examination (10 marks)
Infertility (5 marks)
o Signs of androgen excess- Hair distribution pattern- check for beard, male pattern, temporal
balding
o Weight, height- Obesity
o Acne
o Acanthosis nigricans,
o Breast development,
o Galactorrhoea,
o Enlarged thyroid
Haemorrhage- Anaemia (5 marks)  Tachycardia
 Pedal Edema
 Koilonychia
 Conjuctival and Palmar pallor  Haemic murmur
c) How was the conclusion of a pelvic mass arrived at and what other examination would
you perform to validate the findings? (10 marks)  The conclusion of a pelvic mass would be made on deep palpation of the abdomen. The mass
has a clearly defined upper border but the lower border cannot be palpated i.e. one cannot go
below the mass suprapubically  A bimanual vaginal examination would help differentiate a pelvic mass from an adnexal
mass. To do a bimanual examination two fingers are placed inside the vagina and are
touching the cervix, using the other hand that is placed on the abdomen, the pelvic mass is
moved towards the xiphisternum. If the mass is uterine the cervix will move with it and if not
it will not move and the mass would yet be felt by the fingers touching it initially. The origin
of the mass is then adnexal.
d) What are the differential diagnosis for the pelvic mass? (10 marks) (2 marks each)
Infertility
1. Tubal blockage
2. Uterine abnormalities
3. Cervical incompetence
4. Male infertility
5. Pelvic inflammatory disease
Pelvic mass
I. Uterine pregnancy
II. Uterine leiomyomata (fibroid)
III. Cervical carcinoma
IV. Ovarian cancer/ tumour/ cyst
V. Tubo ovarian abscess
VI. Gestational trophoblastic disease (e.g. Hydatidiform mole)

VIII. Endometrial carcinoma
IX. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding
X. Cervical polyps
XI. Urinary bladder tumours
XII. Lower GIT Mass- colorectal tumours
XIII. Ectopic pregnancy
XIV. Endometrial hyperplasia

e) What investigations would you undertake for this patient? (20marks)
Infertility (5 marks)  Semen analysis  Pelvic ultrasound

FBC To assess anemia
Pregnancy Test and Serum HCG To assess pregnancy or GTD
Hormonal Profile To check for endocrine disorders affecting the menstrual flow. TSH,
T4, FT3, LH, FSH, Oestradiol, Progesterone, Prolactin
Pelvic Ultrasound To know the exact location of the mass
Hysterosalphingiogram/
Intravenous Pyelogram
To assess blockage in fallopian tubes or any abnormality in the
uterus. IVP show the size, shape, and position of the urinary tract (kidney,
bladder, ureters and urethra and it can evaluate the collecting
system inside the kidneys.
ESR/ CRP To show any current infection
Pap Smear For cytology to know whether she has cervix cancer
Blood and urine culture To assess presence of any pathological organisms or infections
Stool Examination for occult blood and ova
Laparascopy To investigate cause of infertility whether she has fibroids, PID etc.
KFTs Check U,E,Cs to know how well the kidney is functioning as some
drugs are excreted via the kidney
LFTs To check if there is any metastasis to the liver hence leading to liver
dysfunction
Semen Analysis To know if there is any abnormality in the count, viscosity, pH etc.

f) From the differential diagnosis, what is the most likely condition and how would you
manage this patient? (20 marks)
Diagnosis  The most likely diagnosis for this patient: A 36 year old para 0 + 1 presenting with
menorrhagia, infertility and a pelvic mass due to uterine leiomyomas/ fibroids and/ or having
tubal blockage
Management
The treatment of this patient will depend on the:
 Symptoms
 Size
 Rate of growth of uterus
 The woman’s desire for fertility
Supportive Management
 Correction of anaemia using haematinics and vitamins in case she has a low haemoglobin
level.
 If she is very anaemia then use of blood transfusion
 Oral contraceptives or progestins can help control menstrual bleeding, but they don't reduce
fibroid size.
 Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are not hormonal medications, may
be effective in relieving pain related to fibroids, but they don't reduce bleeding caused by
fibroids.  Treatment of any infections she has.
 Watchful waiting if there is only mild annoying signs and symptoms and infertility is due to
tubal blockage.
Treatment of fibroids is either medical or surgical or radiological
Medical Tx
Involves use of hormones
I. Drugs used to minimize bleeding and shrink fibroid
II. Combined oral contraceptive pill
III. Progestogens: pills or mirena, IUCD, nevonogesterone
IV. GnRH antagonist e.g. Danazol preoperatively shrink fibroids and reduce menstrual related
anaemia and also reduce menorrhagia
V. GnRH agonist e.g. Leuprolide- preoperatively shrink fibroids and reduce menstrual related
anaemia
Surgical
Is usually done in cases with
a) Symptomatic fibroids
b) Asymptomatic fibroids – rapidly enlarging or raising concerns of leiomyosarcoma
The types of surgery:
 A definitive hysterectomy which will involve removal of the uterus
 If the family size has not been achieved like in her case a myomectomy can be performed to
remove the fibroids
 A myomectomy and tuboplasty can be done incase there is also blockage of the fallopian
tubes
 Other treatment method is use of a radiological treatment i.e. uterine artery embolization and
occlusion
 Endometrial ablation
Counselling
She should also be counselled in case a hysterectomy is chosen or done (TAH) then other methods of
fertility like adoption, IVF using a surrogate mother

### Question 

Jane is a 31 year old para 1 + 1. Her LMP was 6 weeks ago. She had SVD 2 years
ago to a female infant who is alive and well. 8 months ago she had a spontaneous
miscarriage at 8 weeks and MVA was done. She has not been on any
contraception since that miscarriage. Now she presents in your outpatient clinic
with complains of PV bleeding for the last 2 days.
1. What additional history would you take from Jane (15 marks)
 Inquire about her vaginal bleeding- find out amount (no. of pads), colour, whether its fresh
blood or clotted blood (bright red or dark red) and any associated pain or other
constitutional symptoms like fever, nausea or vomiting like hyperemesis gravidarum
 Inquire also if she has noticed any passage of vesicles.
 Inquire whether she has exaggerated pregnancy symptoms hyperemesis - nausea, vomiting
 Inquire whether she has signs of anaemia: easy fatigability, oedema, malaise, dizziness and
shortness of breath
Previous obstetric history
 Inquire about the miscarriage-(spontaneous), when it happened, what was the reason, what
further medical attention was given, whether it was an MVA or D and C. Whether there was
any complications and interventions made, and also if there was histology of the products of
conception
 Inquire also whether she has history of previous molar pregnancy
 Inquire about the living infant, mode of delivery, outcome, and weight.
Gynaecological History
 Inquire about her LNMP, whether it’s regular or irregular, and onset of menarche, any pain
or discomfort during menstruation
 Inquire whether she has had any previous STIs, treatment of herself and her partner
Drug and Contraception History  If she has had any drugs in the past 6 weeks, whether she has been on contraception before, if
yes which one and what was the side effects or adverse effects faced. Family and Social History
Inquire whether in her there is any known cancers. Also whether anyone has suffered from
gestational trophoblastic disease.
Whether there is any use of smoking, drinking alcohol or any drugs of abuse
Systemic Enquiry:
 GIT: Inquire whether there is any change in bowel habits
 CVS and Resp: Palpitations, Shortness of breath,
 CNS: Visual disturbances
 GUT: Incontinence, changes in frequency in case it’s a tumour leading to pressure symptoms

2. What are the possible findings on pelvic of Jane (10 marks)  Inspection of the abdomen would reveal an enlarged abdomen.  The size of the uterus will be larger than the corresponding gestational age  There will be no palpable fetal parts or fetal cardiac activity  On speculum examination- use of Pederson’s speculum there is per vaginal bleeding from the
introitus with vesicles. The pederson’s speculum allows to note if the bleeding is from the
cervix as it allows better vision of the external cervical os.  There will be an open cervix with bluish purplish vesicles (if choriocarcinoma). There could
alsobe products of conception. There may be a decreased length of the cervix and it may be
soft and thin
 On bimanual examination there maybe adnexal masses  There could also be a vaginal discharge a foul smell. A hyperemic vulva
 There may be abdominal tenderness
3. What are the differential diagnosis (5marks)
o Abortion or miscarriage
o Gestational trophoblastic disease (H. mole)
o Ectopic pregnancy
o Implantation bleeding
o Dysfunctional uterine bleeding
o Cervical lesions e.g. Vascular erosions, polyps
o Ruptured varicose veins
You request Jane to do a pregnancy test and a pelvic ultrasound. The pregnancy
test is positive, pelvic Ultrasound shows multiple ovarian cysts in both ovaries
largest measuring 5cm by 4 cm and a uterine mass with ‘snowstorm’ appearance
and no fetus
4. Make a comprehensive diagnosis? (3 marks)
Jane, a 31 year old, para 1+1 gravida 3 with a complete hydatidiform mole pregnancy at 6 weeks
gestation by date and history per vaginal bleeding.
5. List and justify additional investigations you will request for (8 marks)

Beta HCG levels To quantify the amount of  HCG present and determine the baseline
and severity. In a normal pregnancy it doubles in 48 hours while in a
molar pregnancy it may increase at an alarmingly fast and higher
rate. In ectopic pregnancy it increases but does not double in 48
hours.
Full Blood Count To determine and quantify anemia
Coagulation profile (GXM) To rule out a differential of coagulation disorders and also in case
she needs blood transfusion and rule out rhesus disease

Urinalysis In H. mole this is usually a pseudo pre- eclampsia with characteristic
proteinuria before 20 weeks at gestation. If present may come to a
diagnosis and help replenish lost proteins.
Liver function tests Baseline liver function tests for drug administration
U,E,Cs To assess renal function since she might need chemotherapy and the
drugs will be excreted in the drug
X ray Chest x- ray to see if there is metastasis to lungs and abdominal X- ray which could also be used to show the honey comb appearance
though not commonly used presently
Pelvic ultrasound To confirm presence or absence of theca lutein cysts
CT Scan/ MRI To assess metastasis to the brain, is an indicator to good or bad
prognosis
6. Having taken history, examined and investigated Jane, outline her management (10
marks)
Supportive Management
 Counsel Jane on the probable diagnosis and what procedure is going to be done. Also
counsel her on a hysterectomy in case she has uncontrollable bleeding and also about future
infertility
 Give blood transfusion or haematinics (in case anaemic) and take blood for grouping and
cross match in case there is need for transfusion.
 Administer an antibiotic cover in case of suspected infection
 NSAIDS to treat the pain
 Proper hydration
 Follow up with serum beta HCG titres every 2 weeks until titres are normal; then every 2
weeks for 3 months and monthly for 9 months
 Oral contraceptives – for contraception and to regularize menses. Avoid contraception that
may cause abnormal uterine bleeding
 If titres remain normal for a year pregnancy may be allowed again
Definitive Management
 Suction evacuation under 40 IU oxytocin drip with cross matched blood on standby (2- 4
units) using ordinary suction under GA. The Specimen is taken for histology. Suction
evacuation is safer than sharp curettage on this soft uterus, while high dose syntocinon drip
helps reduce haemorrhage that can be fatal.
 Sharp curettage may be done two weeks later to complete the evacuation of vesicles. In this
case blood cross-matching is not necessary as minimal bleeding is expected. In some centres
this step (sharp curettage) has been abandoned.
 Hysterectomy if uncontrollable haemorrhage- as last resort.
 Chemotherapy required if beta HCG levels remain very high. Low risk disease: Methotrexate
and high risk or intermediate risk - EMACO
7. During follow- up, when would you initiate chemotherapy for gestational neoplasia on
Jane (4 marks)
Indications for Chemotherapy
 Serum hCG levels > 20, 000 IU/L at 4 weeks after uterine evacuation.  Rising Beta HCG levels
 Beta HCG levels plateau- i.e. remain at same level in two readings
 Beta HCG levels still elevated after 15 weeks
 Rising levels after reaching normal levels
 Histology of evacuation specimen reveals chorio-carcinoma cells
8. List the cytotoxic agents used as 1st line for management of choriocarcinoma (5 marks)
i) Etoposide
ii) Methotrexate
iii) Actinomycin D
iv) Cyclophosphamide
v) Oncovin/ Vincristine

### Question

During your KNH labour ward rotation, the midwife alerts you about Jane
Njambi, a 39 year old now para 4 +0 who presents as a referral from a peripheral
facility with a history of heavy per vaginal bleeding following a home delivery
assisted by a traditional birth attendant. She delivered about 30 minutes prior to
presentation. The nurse is concerned that Jane has postpartum haemorrhage and
asks you to review the patient

1) Define and classify postpartum haemorrhage? (15marks)
 The most common definition of PPH is estimated blood loss > 500 ml after vaginal birth or >
1000ml, after caesarean delivery OR
 Excessive bleeding after vaginal or caesarean delivery that makes the patient symptomatic
(e.g. pallor, light headedness, weakness, palpitations, diaphoresis, restlessness, confusion, air
hunger, syncope,) and/ or results in signs of hypovolemia (e.g. hypotension, tachycardia,
oliguria, low oxygen saturation [95%])
Classification
Traditional Definition
 Blood loss of > 500 mL following vaginal delivery  Blood loss of > 1000 mL following caesarean delivery
Functional Definition: Any blood loss that has the potential to produce or produces hemodynamic
instability
Definition –time related
 Primary -that bleeding that occurs after delivery of the baby up to the first 24 hours- Most
common cause is uterine atony
 Secondary-any bleeding after 24 hours up to the end of 6 weeks of puerperium- usually due to
sepsis
2) On further enquiry Jane and her family express concern that the outcome would have
been different if this complication was anticipated. You state that the clinician cannot
predict the outcome but can identify risk factors for postpartum haemorrhage. What
are the risk factors for postpartum haemorrhage? (25 marks)

them to be more cautious
 Visit a health care provider if there is any antepartum haemorrhage in subsequent pregnancy
5) One of your colleagues states that Jane’s conditions is a major type of obstetric
haemorrhage, leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity. Describe the other
causes of obstetric haemorrhage (12 marks)
a) Placenta previa: abnormal implantation in the lower uterine segment which is a common site
of trauma during coitus, vaginal examination. It leads to late pregnancy bleeding
b) Abruption placenta: this is detachment of normally implanted placenta, this leads to bleeding
late in pregnancy
c) Uterine rupture: this may occur due to a previous caesarean scar which ruptures during
pregnancy or due to obstructed labour
d) Sepsis also cause haemorrhage by causing DIC
e) Placenta accrete can also cause obstetric haemorrhage by causing retained placenta after
delivery
f) Hypertensive Disorders
