3. List the systems you will examine and some of the salient features you will look for (5x 4 marks each = 20 marks)

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

General Examination for general status of the patient, level of consciousness, pallor, edema, jaundice, the other vital signs(PR, RR, temp).

ENS for level of consciousness, reflexes, lateralizing signs, fundoscopy for retinal changes (A-V nicking)

Respiratory system: dyspnoea, basal crepitations

Per abdominal examination: epigastric tenderness, fundal height, lie, presentation, fetal heart rate, uterine tenderness, uterine
contractions

Vaginal examination for bishop score: cervical position, length, consistency, dilatation

</details>

4. State and rationalize additional investigations you will request for this patient(7x3= total 21 marks)

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

Complete blood count: to assess platelet count and hematocrit level

Serum LDH to rule out microangiopathic haemolysis

Liver function tests(liver enzymes, bilirubin, albumin) to assess for evidence of HELLP syndrome

Kidney function tests to assess for renal failure

Urinalysis to assess for level of proteinuria

Serum Uric acid levels as a predictor of impending IUFD

Coagulation profile, serum fibrinogen levels to rule out a coagulopathy

Obstetric ultrasound/Biophysical profile/Doppler studies/fetal biometrics: to assess fetal status(NRFS, IUGR), weight, presentation in anticipation for delivery

</details>

5. Outline and justify the management plan (10 x 3 = total 30 marks)

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

Investigations to assess for end organ damage

Assessment of Fetal wellbeing: daily fetal kick charts NST, BPP, RI to assess fetal status and determine optimum timing for delivery

Antihypertensives: to control blood pressure, prevent CVA - labetalol, methyldopa, Magnesium sulphate for the first 24 hours: for seizure prophylaxis

Antenatal corticosteroids before delivery: to hasten fetal lung maturity to prevent RDS in the event of preterm delivery

Catheterization: to monitor urine output during administration of MgSO4

Fluid management: to avoid fluid overload pulmonary edema

Monitoring of maternal BP, daily weight, daily urinalysis: to monitor worsening of the disease

Delivery at 34 weeks or earlier in case of deteriorating maternal or fetal status: to prevent maternal and fetal compromise from disease progression eg cerebral hemorrhage, hepatic rupture, renal failure, pulmonary edema, seizure, bleeding related to thrombocytopenia, fetal growth restriction, abruptio placentae, IUFD
