A 26-year-old woman para 1+3 gravida 5 presents to antenatal clinic for her first antenatal visit at 20 weeks gestation. Her antenatal profile results are as follows: Hemoglobin 13.1g/dL, Blood group A-(negative), VDRL non-reactive, HIV non-reactive, HBSag negative, Urinalysis NAD, Rhesus (D) antibodies (32 IU/L)

Questions 

(1) Give a comprehensive diagnosis (4 marks)
<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>
A 26 year old with bad obstetric history secondary to rhesus isoimmunization
</details>

(2) What relevant history would obtain from this patient? (20 marks)
<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

Current pregnancy:

LMP

When quickening occurred

If she is perceiving fetal movements to rule out lUFD

Any complaints: eg LAP, ppt bleeding, drainage of liquor to rule out abortion

Obs/Gyn history:

Details about the previous pregnancies: if blood group was done/known,if she received anti D

Details about last delivery: mode of delivery, birthweight, if the baby is alive, fi the baby had any complications, if she had p h or was transfused after delivery

Details about the 2 miscarriages: gestation at which they occurred, onset of symptoms, fi the babies came out alive or dead

Past medical history:ifshehad had any prior blood transfusion

Family and social history: if the blood group of the father(s) of the previous pregnancies is known

</details>

(3) Describe the pathogenesis of the above condition (max 30 marks)

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

Three conditions must be present for alloimmunization to occur:

The fetus must be Rh+ and the mother must be Rh- (2 marks)

Maternal Exposure to the Rhesus Antigen(1 mark)

This can occur in normal pregnancies, where small amounts of fetal blood pass into maternal circulation(2 marks) or if there has been trans-placental fetomaternal hemorrhage (FMH) (2 marks), or sharing of needles with Rh+ contaminated blood (2marks), or
mismatched blood transfusions (2 marks)

Immunocompetence in the Mother

When the mother is exposed to the Rhesus antigen, maternal response is to produce immunoglobulin § (IgG) against the Rh antigen (2marks).
IgG crosses the placenta (1 mark ) . This Leads alloimmune hemolytic disease of the fetus/newborn(2marks). Fetal red cells, laden with maternal antibodies, are subsequently sequestered and hemolyzed leading to fetal anemia (3 marks). The fetal response is to increase erythropoietin production, which leads to fetal bone marrow and extramedullary hematopoiesis stimulation (3 marks).
Immature red blood cells soon appear in the fetal circulation (erythroblastosis fetalis) as the hemolysis outpaces red cell production(2 marks). If left untreated, fetal portal hypertension, reduced hepatic protein synthesis, increased cardiac output, increased hydrostatic pressure and increased capillary permeability will all lead to the development of fetal hydrops (hydrops fetalis)(6 marks). 
For severely affected fetus this can lead to IUFD(1 mark).  Those mildly affected develop neonatal jaundice that can lead to kernicterus(2 marks)

(4) List and justify the investigations you would perform on this patient (15 marks)
<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

Paternal determination blood group - The pregnancy is at risk only if the fetus has inherited the D antigen. Determining antigen status of the father of the baby can potentially avoid multiple fetal interventions

Serial Maternal D Antibody Titer - To determine timing of intervention/delivery. Indirect coomb’s test

Amniocentesis - To determine the baby's blood group. to obtain amniotic fluid for spectrometry to determine fetal wellbeing

Obstetric ultrasound - Accurate dating for gestational age is crucial to properly interpret fetal tests and to ensure proper timing of fetal interventions

Biophysical profile - To assess fetal well being

</details>

(5) How could the diagnosis in (a) above have been prevented? (6 marks)

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

Antenatal care for all pregnant women

Universal screening of all pregnant women for blood group and rhesus factor status

Timely administration of anti D to all eligible women - 28 weeks GA

All pregnant women to have blood group done and if Rh negative do ICT

Early prediction of haemolysis

Need for active management, preterm delivery, in utero transfusion.
