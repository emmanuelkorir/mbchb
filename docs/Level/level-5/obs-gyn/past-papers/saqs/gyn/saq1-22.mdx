- IIA - No parametrial invasion, upper 2/3rd of the vagina
  - IIA1 - lesion less than 4 cm in greatest dimension
  - IIA2 - lesion is more than 4 cm in greatest dimension
- IIB - obvious parametrial invasion but not into the pelvic wall

Stage III - Tumor extends to the pelvic wall and/or involves the lower third of the vagina and/or causes hydronephrosis/non-functioning kidney
- IIIA - invades lower third of the vagina, no extension into the pelvic side wall
- IIIB - extension into the pelvic wall and/or hydronephrosis or non-functioning kidney

</details>

5. Describe the options for her management giving details of indications (total 10)

<details>
<summary>Check Answer</summary>

Supportive:
- ABC 
- Analgesics - pain management
- Treatment of urinary, vaginal and pelvic infections before surgery 
- Correction of anemia

Definitive:

Surgery for early-stage cancer: IA1, IA2, IB1, IB2, IIA, also for young women for preservation of ovarian function, in the sexually active women because radiotherapy causes vaginal stenosis and atrophy
- Cold-knife conization & Loop electrosurgical excision (LEEP) - carcinoma in situ, HSIL(CIN I, CIN III), stage IA without lymphovascular invasion
- Trachelectomy - removal of cervix, upper vagina & parametrium for stage IA2-IB for patients who wish to conceive
- Hysterectomy - Stage IA1 - IIA 
  - Extended hysterectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection (abdominal or vaginal)
  - Subtotal - supracervical excision
  - Total/simple - excision of uterus & cervix: IA2
  - Radical - en bloc excision with parametrium and upper vagina: IB
- Pelvic exenteration - anterior, posterior or total (removal of all pelvic organs). Stage IVA

Pharmacological:
- Chemotherapy used together with radiotherapy. Neoadjuvant to shrink the tumor before surgical resection. Cisplatin-based Chemotherapy
- radiotherapy - brachytherapy, paris and manchester techniques, stockholm technique
    - For stages IIB - 4

Palliative care
