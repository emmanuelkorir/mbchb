<summary>Check Answer</summary>

Before starting and at every step of the physical examination, take time to explain to the survivor all the procedures you will be performing and why they are necessary. Show and explain to the survivor the instruments to be used and give her/ him a
chance to ask any questions. A family member or friend can be allowed to be present throughout the examination if the survivor so wishes. If available, ensure a trained support person of same sex accompanies
the survivor throughout the examination

A systematic, “Head-to-toe” physical examination of the survivor.

A note the survivor’s general appearance and demeanor. Take the vital signs, i.e. pulse, blood pressure, respiration and temperature. Inspect both sides of both hands
for injuries. Examine the wrists for signs of ligature marks.

Inspect the face and the eyes.

Gently palpate the scalp to check for tenderness, swelling or depression.

Inspect the ears,not forgetting the area behind the ears, for evidence of shadow bruising; shadow bruising develops when the ear has been struck onto the scalp.

Carefully examine the neck.The neck area is of great forensic interest; bruising can indicate life-threatening violence.

Examine the breasts and trunk with as much dignity and privacy as can be afforded.

Inspect the forearms for defense related injuries; these are injuries that occur when the subject raises a limb to ward off force to vulnerable areas of the body, and include
bruises, abrasions, lacerations and incised wounds.

Examine the inner surfaces of the upper arms and armpit or axilla for bruises.

Recline the position of the survivor and for abdominal examination, which includes abdominal palpation to exclude any internal trauma or to detect pregnancy.

While in the reclined position, examine the legs, starting with the front.

If possible, to ask the survivor to stand for inspection of the back of the legs. An inspection of the buttocks is also best achieved with the survivor standing.

Collect any biological evidence with moistened swabs (for semen, saliva, blood) or tweezers (for hair, fibres, grass and soil).

Musculo-skeletal system- physical disabilities, posture control and gait, swellings, bruises, lacerations, dislocations, bite marks, scratches
on the body of survivor from head to toe.

The Genito-Anal Examination for Adults: 

- Try to make the survivor feel as comfortable and as relaxed as possible.
- Explain to them each step of the examination. For example say, “I’m going to have a careful look. I’m going to touch you here in order to look a bit more carefully. Please
tell me if anything feels tender.”
- Examine the external areas of the genital region and anus, as well as any markings on the thighs and buttocks.
- Inspect the mons pubis; examine the vaginal vestibule paying special attention to the labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, hymen or hymenal remnants, posterior fourchette
and perineum
- Take a swab of the external genitalia before attempting any digital exploration or speculum examination. Gently stretch the posterior fourchette area to reveal
abrasions that are otherwise difficult to see.
- If any bright blood is present, gently swab in order to establish its origin, i.e. whether it is vulval or vaginal.
- Warm the speculum prior to use by immersing it in warm water.
- Insert the speculum along the longitudinal plane of the vulval tissues once the initial muscle resistance has relaxed.
- Inspect the vaginal walls for signs of injury, including abrasions, lacerations and bruising. Collect any trace evidence, such as foreign bodies and hairs if found.
- Suture any tears if indicated.
- Remove the speculum
- Details of the anus- shape, dilatation (sphincter muscle tone), fissures, faecal matter on perianal skin, bleeding from rectal
tears.

Document all the findings in the medical register, Post Rape Care (PRC) Form and the Kenya Police Medical Examination P3 Form

Avoid contamination: Ensure that specimens are not contaminated by other materials. Store each exhibit separately. Wear gloves at all times to ensure that the
exhibit is not contaminated and also for your own protection.

Collect early: Try to collect forensic specimens as soon as possible. Specimens should be collected within 24 hours of the violence; after 72 hours, yields are
reduced considerably. Collect the same before requiring the victim to bathe.

Handle appropriately: Ensure that specimens are packed, stored and transported correctly. As a general rule, the fluids (e.g. urine) should be refrigerated; anything
else should be kept dry. . In some instances, blood can be dried on gauze and stored as such. Biological evidence material (e.g. body fluids, soiled clothes) should be
packaged in paper envelopes or bags after drying, avoiding plastic bags.

Label accurately: All specimens must be clearly labelled with the survivor’s name and date of birth, the health care provider name, the type of specimen, and the
date and time of collection.

Ensure security: Specimens should be packed to ensure that they are secure and tamper proof. Only authorised people should be entrusted with specimens.

Maintain continuity: Once a specimen has been collected, its subsequent handling should be recorded. Details of the transfer of the specimen between individuals should also be recorded. An exhibit register should be maintained at each facility

Document collection: It is good practice to compile an itemized list in the survivor’s medical notes or reports of all specimens collected and details of when, and to
whom, they were transferred.

Handling Exhibits: Exhibits should not be exposed to direct light and sunshine. If wet, exhibits are
dried under shade or dark rooms; Exhibits should be marked properly and signed for immediately upon receipt and
stored. All exhibits including documents filled (e.g. PRC, P3) must be kept in places that
guarantee safety and confidentiality.

Possible specimen:
- Mouth swab - for evidence of spermatozoa & DNA, air dry and store in a clean dry bottle with screw top, purpose to identify assailant/victim
- Urine of both the victim and the suspect - Clean dry bottle with screw up, refrigerated, test for spermatozoa, alcohol and drugs; To confirm recent
sexual intercourse. Whether the assailant/victim abuses drugs
- Pubic hair/head hair - Pick the hair using non powdered gloves and store in an envelop or lift using tape store on acetate shee, test for DNA & transfer evidence analysis, Identify assailant
and survivors
- Foreign fibres/grass/soil - Hand pick the foreign fibre/ grass/soil using non powdered gloves and store in a khaki envelope or lift using tape, Fibres found at the incident for transfer evidence analysis
- Liquid blood - A clean sterile dry bottle with screw top or transfer liquid blood onto sterile cotton gauze and air dry (only for control samples) for DNA, Alcohol/drugs
- Semen - HVS, dry semen stained clothes in open air. Do not dry in front of fire or artificial means or directly under the sun. Preserve in khaki paper. Avoid using plastic bags, Spermatozoa Secretor, Blood group assailant DNA proteins in semen (PSA2 or P30)
- Fingernail, scrapping or clippings. Pick the finger nail scrapings/ clippings using non powdered gloves and store in an envelope. To identify assailant DNA
- Blood stained clothes - Dry blood stained clothes in open air. Do not dry in front of fire or artificial means or directly under the sun. Preserve in a khaki paper. Avoid polythene bags
- Bite marks - plasticine for dental impressions to identify assailant

<summary>Check Answer</summary>

Admit the patient to the hospital for further management and investigations.

Management of physical injuries:
- General wound care
- Clean any tears, cuts and abrasions and remove dirt, faeces, and dead or damaged tissue
- Decide if any wounds need suturing. Suture clean wounds within 24 hours. After this time they will have to heal by second intention or delayed primary
suture. 
- Do not suture very dirty wounds. If there are major contaminated wounds, consider giving appropriate antibiotics and pain relief
- If there are any breaks in skin or mucosa, tetanus prophylaxis should be given unless the survivor has been fully vaccinated.
- Clean abrasions and superficial lacerations with antiseptic and either dress or paint with tincture of iodine, including minor injuries to the vulva and perineum.
- If stitching is required, stitch under local anaesthesia. If the survivor’s level of anxiety does not permit, consider sedation or general anaesthesia.
- High vaginal vault, anal and oral tears and 3rd/4th degree perineal injuries should be assessed under general anaesthesia by a gynaecologist or other qualified personnel and repaired accordingly.
- In cases of confirmed or suspected perforation, laparatomy should be performed and any intra-abdominal injuries repaired in consultation with a general surgeon
- Provide analgesics to relieve the survivor of physical pain.

Post traumatic vaccination with Tetanus Toxoid
- Where any physical injuries result in breach of the skin and mucous membranes, immunize with 0.5mls of tetanus toxoid. 

PEP - PEP should be started within 72 hours of the assault. Triple therapy with TDF + 3TC +ATV/r. In the event that the survivor tests HIV positive, PEP IS NOT RECOMMENDED. People presenting later than 72 hours after sexual violence should be offered other aspects of post rape care, except PEP.

Pregnancy prevention - EC should be given within 120 hours/ 5 days of sexual violence; ideally as early as possible to maximize effectiveness. EC should be given to all females who have experienced menarche except
those on menses, pregnant or on reliable contraceptive methods. EC does not harm an early pregnancy. Options: Levornogestrel only or Combined
Estrogenprogesterone pills. A follow-up pregnancy test at four weeks should be offered to all women who return,
regardless of whether they took EC after the sexual violence occurrence or not. 

Management of STI - STI prophylaxis should be offered to all survivors of sexual violence. • Preventive STI regimens can start on the same day as emergency contraception
and post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (PEP). Cefixime/ceftriaxone + azithromycin/doxycycline + tinidazole.  

Hepatitis B vaccination - n is intended to provide protection from future Hepatitis B virus infection. 1st dose at first contact, second at 1 month, third at 6 months.

Pyscho-social Support - Provide psychosocial support to the survivor. Adherence counselling for PEP, STI prophylaxis and treatment, and other
management. Counselling on Emergency Contraception and unwanted pregnancies. Psycho-education. Adherence to follow-up sessions. Psychosocial support e.g. support groups for survivors, family and relatives.
