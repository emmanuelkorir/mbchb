### Question 1

Miss Mutua is a 29 year old Para 0 + 0 who has been on Highly Active

 Protective factors – HPV vaccination (1)
2. What is the association between HIV, HAART and premalignant and malignant lesions
of the cervix (5 marks)
 The incidence of cervical intraepithelial lesions is higher at HIV infected women (1)
 Recurrence of CIN is more frequent in HIV infected women with CIN than in the general
population (1)
 The risk of recurrence of CIN in HIV infected women correlates inversely with the degree of
immunosuppression (1)
 HAART treatment is associated with beneficial effects in HIV infected patients regarding CD4
count and HIV RNA load; improvements in these measures are also associated with a lower
risk of CIN and cervical cancer (1)

she is lost to follow p for 5 years and reappears in outpatient with complains of
heavy per vaginal bleeding for 3 months and not passing urine for 5 days.
