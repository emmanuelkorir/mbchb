# Scientific Basis of Obs & Gyn

## Anatomy of Female Pelvis and Fetal Skull

## Framework of pelvic wall

- Bones: 2 hipbones (ilium, ischium, pubis), sacrum coccyx

- Ligament: sacrotuberous, sacrospinous (sacrum—ischial spine); ST & SP ligament
  form greater & lesser sciatic foramina , iliolumbar

- Joints: saroilliac, pubic symphisis

- Membranes: obturator membrane on each side & perineal membrane

- Muscles: pitiformis (each posterior wall), obturstor internus originating from lateral
  pelvic wall (each antlat), levator ani & coccygeus (pelvic diaphragm/pelvic
  floor/inferiorly)

## Boundaries of pelvic inlet, outlet and mid cavity

- Outlet boundaries: Pecten pubis (pectineal lineal). Smallest diameter is AP (10.11 cm)

</div>

- Pelvic cavity: superiorly pelvic inlet, inferiorly outlet, post the sacrum, on each side ilium &
  ischium, anteriorly pubic symphysis, 2 pubic rami and obturator foramina, obturator fascia.
  Midpelvis runs from lower margin of symphysis, via ischial spine to lower tip of sacrum
  (Ischial spine is slightly below cavity), interspinous diameter is the smallest diameter of the
  pelvis (station 0)

- Pelvic outlet: smallest diameter is inter-tuberous in outlet. Outlet is wider from front towards
  to back and narrower from side to side

Most important prognostic factor for labor progression is relationship of fetal skull to maternal pelvis. This relationship is determined by the foetal lie, presentation, attitude and position.

## Types & Characteristics of Female Pelvis

- Gynecoid (typical female): oval, transverse diameter > AP, wide and shallow pelvis
  with parallel side walls, wide suprapubic arch (reduces the waste space of Morris),
  wide interspinous and intertuberous diameter, wide and well rounded anterior
  segment. Normal mechanism of labor

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/8qtwjH7.png" alt="gynecoid" />
</div>

- Anthropoid: long, narrow, oval but AP > Tr, deep cavity with parallel/straight side
  walls, long, narrow well rounded anterior segment, very wide and shallow
  sacrosciatic notch, long narrrow with average inclination, slightly narrow suprapubic
  arch. Hinders engagement of fetal head, commonly POPP. Seen in unusually tall and
  well built women

</div>

- Android (typical male): wedge shaped, funnel shaped, deep cavity with convergent
  walls, narrow retropubic angle, forward sacral inclination, narrow interspinous and
  intertuberous diameter, flat and posterior segment, narrow sacrosciatic notch, narrow
  suprapubic arch. Associated with severe tears because head is displaced backwards

</div>

- Platypelloid: transverse oval shaped inlet/contracted from backwards with Tr> Ap,
  shallow cavity with divergent side walls, a very wide, round retropubic angle, very
  wide and flat posterior, a narrow sacrosciatic notch, average sacral inclination, very
  wide suprapubic arch. Deep transverse arrest is common

</div>

## Types of AP diameters of pelvis inlet

- Obstetric: from mid sacral promontory to mid
  inner point of arch. Most clinically important
  AP diameter of inlet. 10 cm (subtract 1.5cm
  to 2cm from DC)

- True: upper outer to mid point of promontory
  (11cm) (subtract 1.2cm from DC)

- Diagonal conjugate: from lower part of inner
  pubic symphysis to mid promontory. About
  12cm (the only one that can be measured
  clinically on digital VE)

## Contrast between male and female pelvis

- Female is tilted forward, adapted for childbearing, cavity of the true pelvis is broad,
  shallow and has a greater capacity. Male pelvis is
  less tilted forward, adapted for support of males’s
  heavier build and stronger muscles, true pelvis is
  narrow and deep
- Female: rounder inlet because sacral promontory is
  less projecting, wider inlet, wider outlet (obtuse
  pubic angle, ischial tuberosity are farther apart &
  everted, greater sciatic notches are shallower and
  wider), lighter/thinner/smoother, shallow but spacious cavity, lighter and thinner,
  bony markings are less prominent, acetabulum is smaller and farther apart, relatively
  shorter pubic symphysis, everted ASIS, coccyx more movable and projects
  downwards, shorter and broader sacrum, more movable sacrum, broader pubic arch,
  wider & shorter sacrum

## Parts of fetal skull

- Parts of fetal skull: vault (supra orbital to nape of neck), face (supra orbital & root of
  nose/Glabella to connection between floor of mouth/mentum & neck) and base (area
  between face and vault)

- Sutures (non ossified membranes that connect skull bones): frontal (F-F), Sagittal (P-P), coronal (F-P), lambdoid (P-O).

- Fontanels (wide gaps in suture lines that connect between sutures): Anterior/Bregma
  (F-S-2C) and posterior (S-2L)

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>

    alt="fontanels"
    height={450}
    width={450}
  />
</div>

- Anterior fontanelle: diamond shaped with soft membrane floor, surrounded by 4
  bones and fuses by 1 ½ years, with moulding no overriding of bone since they are
  widely separated. Posterior fontanelle is triangular area with bony floor, surrounded
  by 3 bones, bones overlap during labor, fuses at term.

- Clinical importance of fontanelle and sutures: palpation identifies degree of fetal head
  flexion (good flexion of head: posterior fontanelle easily felt and can’t feel anterior
  fontanelle), facilitate moulding (bones glide over each other) during labor so passage
  of head is easier, position of posterior fontanelles and sagittal suture identifies attitude
  and vertex position, palpitation of posterior fontanelle during labour can be used to
  tell internal rotation, in deep transverse arrest sagittal suture lies transversely along
  ischial spine, after birth fontanelle useful is assessing condition of baby, remains
  membranous after birth thus allow for brain growth

- Areas of fetal skull: Brow/sinciput:
  area in front of coronal suture. Vertex:
  Area bounded Anteriorly: Anterior
  fontanelle & coronal sutures, Post:
  posterior fontanelles & lambdoid
  suture and laterally two longitudinal
  lines passing via parietal eminence.
  Occiput: area behind lambdoid sutures

- Diameters of fetal skull: longitudinal and transverse.
  Presenting longitudinal diameter/engaging diameter depends on degree of flexion of presenting part.
  - Suboccipitalbregamatic: Nape of neck to center of bregma.
  - Completely Flexed head: vertex presentation, has the smallest diameter
  - Occipitalfrontal: occipital
    eminence to root of nose (Deflexed: vertex, this diameter may caused
    prolonged labor)
  - Verticalmental; midpoint of chin to highest point of saggital suture/vertical
    point. (Partial extension: Brow presentation, baby has to delivered by C
    SECTION)
  - Submentobregmatic: from junction of flow of mouth and neck to center of
    sagittal suture (Incomplete extension: Face presentation, baby has to be
    delivered by C SECTION)
- Transverse: Biparietal : between 2 parietal eminence (engaging diameter in all
  attitude). Bitemporal (C- coronal), Bimastoid (between 2 mastoid eminence)

## Fetal skull changes during labor

- **Moulding:**changes in shape of the head in vertex presentation during labour while
  passing through the resistant birth canal. Mechanism is by overlapping of cranial
  bones at the membranous joints due to compression of the engaging diameter of the
  head. It is physiological, harmless and disappears within a few hours after birth.

  - **Grade 0:** bones lie side by side with intervening membrane
  - **Grade ++:** bones touch with no overlap
  - **Grade +++:** overlapping but easily separated by pressure
  - **Grade ++++:** fixed overlap and can’t be separated

- **Caput succedaneum:** present at birth on normal vaginal delivery, may lie on sutures,
  not well defined, soft, pits on pressure, skin is echymotic, size largest at birth ,
  gradually subsides within a day, no underlying fracture, no treatment required

- **Cephalhematoma:** collection of blood between periosteum and skull bone which is
  limited by the periosteal attachments at the suture lines. appears after 12 hours of
  birth, limited by suture lines, well defined, tends to grow larger, disappears within 6-8
  weeks. it is circumscribed, soft and non pitting. may be associated with skull bone
  fracture. no treatment required. the blood is absorbed and the swelling subside.

## Fetal lie, presentation, attitude, position

- **Foetal Lie:** the position of the long axis of the baby in relation to the long axis of the
  mother.

- **Presentation:** the part of the fetus that is closest to the pelvic inlet

- **Fetal attitude:** the posture of the fetus in labor (normally the fetal head is flexed)

- **Fetal Position:** the location of an arbitrarily chosen point of the presenting foetal part
  in relation to the left or right side of the maternal pelvis

## Abnormalities of pelvis

- Developmental abnormalities may lead to: Contracted pelvis (pelvic injuries &
  childhood malnutrition eg rickets: contracted pelvis means reduced one of pelvic
  diameters resulting in interfered labor mechanism), High assimilation (6 sacral
  vertebrae), Naegle’s oblique pelvis (one-sided fusion of the ischium & ilium),
  Robert’s contracted pelvis (bilateral fusion of the ilium & ischium), simple flat pelvis

- Diseases & injury may lead to difficulties in delivering vaginally: Rickets (rachitic
  flat pelvis), poliomyelitis, Malunion of pelvic fractures

- Abnormalities of the hip joint, spine & lower limbs may make vaginal delivery
  impossible: Kyphosis, Spondylolisthesis, Congenital dislocation of the hip
